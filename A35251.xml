            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>NOthing is more obvious than that Ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, Envy and Emulation are the uſual Attendants on the Courts of Princes, and that the effects of them have been often very fatal to many Great Men, who had the fortune to have a larger ſhare in their Maſters affections than others. It is likewiſe as noto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious, That there are certain Criſes of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, wherein Princes have been obliged to Sacrifice their darling, Miniſters either to their own ſafety or to the importunity of their People. Lastly it is as evident, That ſome Court-Favourites have justly merited the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy Fate they met with, for their many Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pines, Inſolencies and Enormities, as that others have been ruined meerly from the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prichio or inconstant Temper of the Prince whom they ſerved. Of all theſe, in my opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, the enſuing Favourites are pregnant In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances. But I ſhall leave the Reader to par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulariſe them according to his own Judgment and will only add, That they are not all to be condemned as Criminal, meerly becauſe they all happened to be unfortunate.</p>

            <p>THAT Unhappy Prince, <hi>Edward</hi> the 2d. was cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly the moſt Unfortunate in his Favourites of any King of England, either before or fince his Reign: The firſt and Fatal Favourite he had was in his Youth, before he came to the Crown, whoſe name was Peirce Gaveſton, born in Gaſcoigne, a Province of France, and for the good Service per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed by his Father in the Wars in that Kingdom, his Son was taken into ſuch Favour at Court, that by K. Edward the Firſt's own appointment he was Edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated, and made a Companion to the young Prince: And indeed his outward Accompliſhments ſeemed to render him worthy of ſuch great Honour, being a Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of a ſharp Wir, an excellent Shape, and of a va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liant Temper, of which he gave notable proof in a Battel againſt the Scots, and for which they after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward bore him a mortal Hatred: But all theſe worthy Qualities were utterly defac'd and clouded by his vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Incli<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ations, ſo that as to his Chriſtian and Moral Vertues, which are only really commendable in Men, Authors are very ſilent in mentioning them, though all give large accounts of his Faults and Immora<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ities.</p>
            <p>And King Edward was ſo ſenſible, that his Son the Prince had been debauched by the corrupt Converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Gaveſtone, that ſome time before his Death he was baniſhed the Kingdom: And upon his Death<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed commanding the Prince his Son to repair to him
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:57822:4"/>
with all ſpeed to Carliſle in Cumberland, where he was with a great Army ready to invade Scotland: He gave him many worthy Admonitions, and much good Advice, particularly, That he ſhould be merciful, juſt, and kind, faithful in word and deed, an incourager of thoſe that were good, and ready to relieve thoſe that were in diſtreſs; That he ſhould be loving to his two Brothers Thomas and Edmund, but eſpecially to honour and reſpect his Mother Queen Margaret; That upon pain of his Malediction and Curſe he ſhould not preſume without common conſent to recall Peirce Gaveſtone from Exile (who for abuſing his tender Years with wicked practices by common Decree of the Nobility was baniſhed): He alſo added a ſtrange Injunction for a dying man, namely, That after his Death the Prince ſhould not preſume to take the Crown of England till he had honourably revenged the Injuries his Father had received from the Scots, and finiſht the preſent Expedition againſt them, and that he ſhould carry his Father's Bones about with him in a Coffin, till he had marched through all Scotland, and ſubdued all his Enemies, aſſuring him that while they were with him he ſhould be always victorious.</p>
            <p>Laſtly; Whereas by the continual Attempts of Bruce King of Scotland, he was prevented from per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming his Vow of going in Perſon for the recovery of Jeruſalem and the Holy Land from the Infidels, that he ſhould ſend his Heart thither accompanied with 140 Knights and their Retinue, for whoſe ſupport he had provided Thirty two thouſand pounds of Silver; That after his Heart was conveyed thither, he hoped in God all things would proſper with them; Adjuring the Prince upon pain of Eternal Damnation, that he ſhould not expend the Money upon any other uſe. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter theſe Admonitions, and having taken an Oath of this vain Young Prince, to perform his Will, he gave up the Ghoſt.</p>
            <p>After his Father's Death, the Son ſoon made it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear how little regard he had to perform his dying

Requeſts, and to ſhew what his future Behaviour was like to be, he in the firſt place revenged himſelf up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Walter Langton Biſhop of Cheſter, Lord Treaſurer of England, and Principal Executor of his Father's Laſt Will, whom he impriſoned in Wallingford Caſtle, ſeizing upon all his Eſtate, no man daring to inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cede on his behalf, becauſe of the extream hatred which the King ſhewed againſt him, the Biſhop's Crime being only in uſing a modeſt freedom in K.

            <p>Soon after the young King married Iſabel Daughter to Philip the Fair of France, the March being conclud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed before his Father's death, and was now performed with extraordinary Magnificence at Bullen: At which Solemnity there were five Kings, namely, Philip the French King, the K. of Almain, the K. of Sicily, the K. of Navar, and K. Edward the Bridegroom, and four Queens, Mary Q. of France, Margaret the Q. Mother of England, her Daughter the Q. of Navar, and Iſabel the Bride, Q. of England: There were likewiſe pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent a great number of Perſons of Honour and Quality, and among them the beloved Peirce Gaveſtone, who was entertained with the tendereſt affection imagin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able by K.

            <p>The Lords who had hitherto paſt by the private Affronts and Injuries they had daily received, in hope that the King might in time have ſeen his Errours, which they by their daily Admonitions endeavoured to make him ſenſible of, finding that he ſtill perſiſted in the ſame Courſes, which grew now intolerable, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved more plainly to remonſtrate the matter to him, telling him, That to their great grief they perceived that his Dotage and ill-placed Affection was unlimited toward Gaveſtone, a Perſon of a wicked and infamous Life, whoſe Father was a Traytor to the French King, and was hanged for the ſame: That his Mother was burnt for a Witch, and that he himſelf was baniſht for being a Confederate with her in her curſed Witch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crafts, and that they did verily believe he had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>witcht the King, or elſe certainly he could never re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain ſuch an unreaſonable Paſſion for ſo profligate a Wretch: That they much doubted he would abuſe his Greatneſs ſo far as to bring Foreigners into the Land to defend him in his lawleſs and deſtructive Courſes, to the utter Ruine of the Laws, Liberties and Eſtates of his Subjects; They therefore humbly deſire him to hearken to the Advice of his Peers, which would be both for his own Honour, and the Welfare of his People, and particularly, 1. That he would confirm and maintain thoſe Antient Laws and Cuſtoms which were contained in the Charters of the Kings his Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deceſſors. 2. That he would not force any man to part with his goods without payment of the full value thereof. 3. That whatever Money, Lands, Jewels, or other valuable things had been given away or alienated

from the Crown ſince his Father's death might be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtored. 4. That he would remember the Oath he had taken to his Father before his death not to recall Peirce Gaveſton from his Baniſhment: And for pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecuting the War againſt Scotland, and that he would rectifie all that had hitherto been amiſs, that ſo his Enemies might have no cauſe to rejoice, nor his Friends be any longer troubled and diſquieted: Laſtly, That no man ſhould be reſtrained by the King's Writ from proſecuting his Suits in any Court of Juſtice, for defending his Right and Property, but that Juſtice might be impartially adminiſtred throughout the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom both to Rich and Poor, according to the antient and approved Conſtitutions, Cuſtoms and Laws of England.</p>
            <p>The King taking Counſel of Peirce Gaveſtone and his Complices, commanded the Lord Chancellor to tell the Lords that he would give them ſatisfaction to their demands at the next Seſſion of Parliament. The Barons were no ſooner gone out of London to their own homes, but the King ordered the Gates of City to be ſhut, and the Streets to be chained, and and ſtrict Watch to be kept, &amp; then with ſome Forces, both Engliſh and Foreigners, marched in company of Gaveſton to Wallingford Caſtle, and as his Conſcience did not trouble him for the breach of his Oath, ſo their diſlike increaſed his love to Gaveſion, for none but Gaveſton muſt do all, and nothing was accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table nor grateful but what came from his hand. However the King's laviſhneſs having quite emptied his Exchequer, he was compelled to comply with the Parliament at their next Meeting in London, ſo far as to paſs an Act for Gaveſton's perpetual Baniſhment, and for ſecuring the Liberty of the Subject, and the due execution of Juſtice, which the King confirmed by a ſolemn Oath, and for which they gratified him with a ſubſidy of the twentieth part of their Eſtates. In pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuance of this Decree Gaveſton is ſent by the King in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Ireland, himſelf accompanying him in Perſon as

He was no ſooner arrived there but the King ſent Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſengers to him with his gracious Letters, requiring him to be cheerful and merry in his exile, aſſuring him that his troubles ſhould in the end be recompenced with greater dignities and favours than he had yet re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, and indeed the King's mind was ſo fondly tranſported that he could not live without him, and the exigency of his affairs being over, he ſoon made it appear that what he had done againſt him was abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely contrary to his humour, and that his Heart went not along with his Tongue and Hand.

<pb n="9" facs="tcp:57822:7"/>
this the King Summoned a Parliament to meet at Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thampton, deſigning to go from thence to Scotland. The Barons came thither well armed and guarded, of which the King having intelligence ſent them word he would not come, yet at laſt he came as far as Stony-Stratford, to whom the Lords ſent the Earls of War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wick and Clare, with their earneſt intreaties that for his own ſafety and the benefit of the Kingdom he would appear at his Parliament. Whereupon he was prevailed with to come in the Habit of an Eſquire, and the Lords were preſent unarmed, and in concluſion an happy agreement was made, and the Expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to Scotland laid aſide for the preſent.</p>
            <p>Soon after the Parliament aſſembled at London, to which came Lewes Brother to the French King, and the Biſhop of Poictou, to endeavour to ſettle a laſting Concord between the King and the Peers. At this Parliament many good Laws were Enacted, and among others one for baniſhing Peirce Gaveſton once again, which the King was obliged to paſs tho' ſore againſt his will, with this condition added by the Lords, That if he were ever found again in any of the King's Dominions he ſhould be taken as a Common Enemy, and executed by Martial Law without any farther Tryal.</p>
            <p>Hereupon Gaveſton went into France, but that King being his ſworn Enemy upon the account of the Queen his Daughter, he durſt not continue long in any one place, but wandred from one Country to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſeeking for Reſt but could find none.

But the obſtinate King would not condeſcend to their deſires, reſolving to loſe all rather than part with his dear Gaveſton; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he inſtantly ſent for ſeveral Foreign Souldiers, and having hired three hundred Horſemen commanded by the Earl of Hannow and the Viſcount Foix, in their paſſage through France for England, they were ſeized by that King, who kill'd moſt of the Souldiers and hanged up the Officers, He then ſolicited aid from Robert Bruce King of Scotland, from <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 span">

Whereat being inraged he fortified Windſor Caſtle, and built Forts in ſeveral other parts of the Kingdom. The Lords likewiſe raiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Forces, and reſolved to march toward York, from
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:57822:8"/>
whence the King was gone to Sea for his recreation, leaving Gaveſton behind him, who lodged in the Caſtle, and cauſed that and the City alſo to be ſtrength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with new Fortifications. The Barons rendez<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouſed at Bedford, where they made Gilbert Earl of Gloceſter Lord Keeper of England, and ordered ſtrict Guards to be ſet upon the Sea-Coaſts for preventing any Foreign Forces from landing to aſſiſt the Ring. From hence they proceeded to York, at whoſe approach Gaveſton fled from thence to Scarborough, the Lords purſued him thither, and Beſieging the Town they quickly took it, and made him a Priſoner, committing him to the Cuſtody of Aymer de Valence Earl of Pembroke, who carried him to a Village called Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thington between Oxford and Warwick, deſigning to have conveyed him the next day to Wallingford Caſtle, and going that night to lodge with his Counteſs who was hard by, the next morning Guy Earl of War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wick with a ſtrong Party took him away from thence and brought him to Warwick Caſtle. And the Lords having called a Council of War it was unanimouſly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved by the Earls of Lancaſter, Warwick and Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford that he ſhould be inſtantly put to death, as a ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verter of the Government, and a notorious Traytor to the Kingdom. And thereupon he was carried to a place called Blacklow, and afterward Gaveſhead, where he was beheaded in the preſence of the Lords aforementioned in 1312. His Body was by the Friers Predicant conveyed to Oxford, and there kept above two years, till the King cauſed it to be removed to Kings Langley in Hartfordſhire, where he in perſon (to demonſtrate his endeared affection to him dead as well as living) attended with the Archbiſhop of Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terbury, four Biſhops with many Abbots and princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal Clergy Men, cauſed him to be interred in the Friers Church which he had built, with all manner of Funeral Pomp and Solemnity: Few or none of the Temporal Lords being preſent, whoſe great Hearts could not comply to honour him being dead whom

            <p>This unnatural diviſion between the King and his Peers was much heightned by the ill Offices of the Queens Kindred and Countrymen the French, who coming over in great numbers to attend the ſolemni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the Baptizing the King's Son (afterward the Victorious King Edward III.) who was about this time born at Windſor, they ſo aggravated theſe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings of the Lords againſt him, that he who was too much inflamed before, ſeemed now irreconcile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to them. So that nothing but the miſeries of an Inteſtine War were expected. To prevent which, the young Queen, the Biſhops and ſome other Noblemen, procured an enterview between them, where the King ſharply charged the Barons for their rebellious and preſumptuous taking up Arms againſt him, and for ſeizing and wickedly murdering his dear and faithful Friend Peirce Gaveſton: The Lords reſolutely an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered, That they were not guilty of Rebellion, nor had done any thing but what deſerved his Royal thanks and favour, ſince they had not raiſed any Forces a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt his Sacred Perſon but only in their own defence, and to bring to Juſtice that impious Traytor Peirce Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſton the publick Enemy and Fire-brand of the Realm. But though both were very fierce in words, yet the Queen and Biſhops uſed all manner of means to prevent their coming to action, and by their inceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant endeavours wrought ſo effectually, that the King ſeemed willing to be pacified if they would acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:57822:10"/>
their Fault. And the Lords for preventing the dangers which now threatned them from Robert Bruce King of Scotland, were contented to make their humble ſubmiſſions to the King in open Court at Weſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minſter, and deſired him to forgive all their offences againſt him; which the King graciouſly granted them offering his Pardon to all that would Petition him for the ſame. Upon which happy agreement, the Parliament then ſitting being ſenſible of the King's great want of money, freely granted him a fifteenth of their Eſtates for his ſupport. But Guy Earl of Warwick did not long ſurvive this happy union, being ſecretly Poiſoned, as the Lords reported, by ſome of the King's Friends.</p>
            <p>The Office of Lord Chamberlain being vacant by the death of Peirce Gaveſton, the Nobility recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended Hugh Spencer the younger to the King to ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed in his place, becauſe he had been formerly of their Party, and they did not doubt but he would be a very faithful Counſellor. But as the Proverb ſays, Honours change Manners, for though the King before hated him, yet he ſoon inſinuated himſelf ſo far into his weak Mind, that he became as intimate a Favourite, and ſucceeded in all the Graces, Familiarity and Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of his Predeceſſor, as well as in the Hatred and En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy of the Nobility and People, occaſioned by his Inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, Ambition and Lewdneſs, wherein he ſeemed to equal if not exceed the Wicked Gaveſton, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by rendred himſelf ſo acceptable to the vitiated Soul of King Edward. Hugh Spencer his Father an antient Knight was yet living, and accounted a Perſon of great vertue, a wiſe Counſellor, and a Man of Valour, but ſeeming very forward in promoting his Son's Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt and Grandeur, he was likewiſe introduced into Court, and in great favour with the King, ſo that he was made partaker of the guilt and calamity of his Son, rather out of Natural and Paternal Love and Tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, than from the wilfulneſs or depravity of his Mind.</p>

So that in compariſon of him the People were ready almoſt to wiſh for Gaveſton a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain. By his leud advice the K. purſued his former courſe of Debauchery, ſpending his Time and Treaſure among laſcivious Harlots and Concubines, and utterly renouncing the ſweet Converſation of his excellent Conſort, which made him a ſcorn to Foreign Princes, and hateful in the ſight of all Civil Men. He was the cauſe of the ruin of divers Widows and Fatherleſs, of the deſtruction of many Noblemen and Gentlemen, and at length of the utter overthrow and confuſion of Himſelf, his Father, and the King alſo.</p>
            <p>This evil management of Affairs cauſed new dſcords between the King and his Nobility, whereby many miſchiefs happened in the Kingdom, and their Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies had a fair opportunity to put in practice their deſigns againſt them. Among others, the Scots hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing joyfully Crowned the valiant Robert Bruce for their King, reſolved to uſe their utmoſt efforts for recover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their Country and Liberties, which had been Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſhed from them by the valiant King Edward I. who had made an entire Conqueſt of their Kingdom, and appointed John Cummin Earl of Buquan a Scot, to be Governour thereof for the Engliſh. Him King Robert had vanquiſht in Battel, and was now grown ſo power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, while King Edward was buried in ſoft and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manly luxury and delight, that he ſent his Brother Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward to Beſiege the Caſtle of Sterling, which bold attempt began to awaken the King of England out of his deſtructive Slumbers: So that with all ſpeed rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing a very potent Army, he with all diligence march<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed toward the relief thereof. Hector Boetius the Scots Hiſtorian gives a very ſurprizing account of the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of Soldiers that King Edward carried with him to this Siege, which he reckons to be one hundred and

            <p>His Darling Spencer accompanied the King in this Expedition, but the Earls of Lancaſter, Warren, Warwick and Arundel, the greateſt Peers of that Age, poſitively refuſed to attend him, ſince He and his Evil Miniſters continued their Invaſions and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>predations upon the Liberties and Eſtates of the People, notwithſtanding the proviſions they had ſo often made, and he had ſo often conſented to for ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curing the ſame: And as this muſt needs diminiſh his ſtrength, ſo it likewiſe deprived him of their Counſel and Conduct, which was ſo abſolutely neceſſary in Military Affairs: However, his number of Men was ſufficient, if Multitude without Diſcipline, Piety, or Courage, could always obtain Victory: But K. Edward and his Army ſeemed rather to be going to a Wed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding or a Triumph, than to engage a rough and hardy Enemy for their Targets, Bucklers, and other Habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liments of War, were ſo glorious with Gold and Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, and their bright Armour gave ſuch a dazling luſtre againſt the Sun-beams, as raiſed wonder in the admiring Spectators, and ſeemed very much to corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpond with the wanton Humour of the Prince: And herein it is very apparent what great Advantages true and ſober Courage uſually obtains againſt vain Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lantry, and ungrounded Confidence: King Robert

with his Forces (which were much inferiour to the Engliſh) being incampt near King Edward's, he pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed a ſtrict Order the Evening before, That his Souldiers ſhould prepare themſelves for Battel the next day, and that they ſhould make humble Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of their ſins and offences in order to the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving of the Bleſſed Sacrament; and then no doubt the Lord of Hoſts would give them Victory, ſince they deſigned only to free themſelves from the many wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Calamities which they had ſuffered from the Engliſh, and to recover the Liberty and Freedom of their Countrey.</p>
            <p>Far otherwiſe was it in the Camp of K.

<pb n="18" facs="tcp:57822:12"/>
and diſmal Diſcomfiture of his Horſe in thoſe miſchievous Ditches, utterly confounded all his mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, ſo that he was compelled after ſome diſordered Reſiſtance, to leave to the Scots the greateſt Victory that ever they obtained againſt the Engliſh in any Age either before or ſince: King Edward could hardly be perſuaded to make his Eſcape, it being the firſt time that ever he diſcovered any ſymptoms of the Courage of a Valiant Engliſh King; but at length being over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſuaded by his Friends, himſelf and his cowardly Favourite Spencer, whom K. Edward's own Hiſtorian calls, A Faint-hearted Kite, fled with all ſpeed to a place of ſafety. All things proved unfortunate in this Battle, for when the Foot perceived the Horſe in that wretched condition, they ſhot their Arrows at the Scots, who came to kill them, but they being Armed in their fore-parts, received little or no damage, ſo that they ſlew a great number of their Friends whoſe backs were towards them unarmed: The loſs fell much upon the Nobility, for there was ſlain in this Battel Gilbert Clare Earl of Gloceſter, a Man of ſingular Valour and Wiſdom, the Lord Clifford, with ſeveral other Peers, beſides ſeven hundred Knights, Eſquires, and Officers of Note: The ſlaughter of the reſt could not be great, ſince the Scots fought on foot: Hector Boetius ſaith, There were 50000 Engliſh kill'd, though no other Author will allow of above 10000. The Riches and Plunder taken, doubtleſs was very valu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able. Among the Priſoners, the chief was Humphrey Bohun Earl of Hereford, who was after exchanged for King Robert's Queen, who had been long time Priſoner in England.</p>
            <p>This Battel was fought at a place called Bannocks Boum near Sterling in Scotland, on Midſummer day, June 24, 1314. and King Robert having been for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly Reſident in England, Treated the Priſoners with all kind of Civility, and ſent the Bodies of the Earl of Gloceſter, and Lord Clifford, to England, to be honourably buried with their Anceſtors: From

this Overthrow King Edward and his Minion Spencer made their Eſcape to Berwick, and came from thence to York, where he publickly declared, That he was reſolved inſtantly to raiſe new Forces, and to regain the Honour he had loſt, or elſe to loſe his Life in the Attempt: But all his Deſigns of that kind proved ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly fruitleſs: For ſoon after the ſtrong, and almoſt impregnable Caſtle of Berwick, was treacherouſly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trayed into the hands of King Robert by one Peter Spalding, whom the King of England had made Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour thereof, but he inſtead of the promiſed Reward was hanged by the King of Scots for his Treachery: After this the King raiſed another Army againſt the Scots, but received a ſecond great and unhappy Over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw, returning home with much Ignominy and Shame, leaving his Subjects in the North diſtreſt and unrelieved from the continual Ravages of their Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>placable Enemies the Scots, in as lamentable a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner as ever any People were abandoned by an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy and careleſs Prince.</p>
            <p>Of theſe Diſgraces, Loſſes and Troubles, we may make this uſeful Obſervation; That as the Heroick Virtues of excellent Princes are uſually crowned with Bleſſings from Heaven; ſo for the Iniquities and hei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous Tranſgreſſions of wicked and ungodly Kings, both themſelves and their Subjects likewiſe are ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verely puniſhed by the Almighty, before whom Princes muſt fall as well as common Men, except their true and hearty Repentance, with amendment of their Lives, do procure his Mercy and Favour be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it be too late: And indeed the Hand of God ſeem'd now ſtretcht out againſt this Kingdom; for about this time ſo great a Peſtilence and Mortality happened, that the Living were hardly ſufficient to bury the Dead. This was attended with a dreadful Famine occaſioned by immoderate Rains in Harveſt, which deſtroyed all the Corn almoſt throughout Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, and at length the Dearth grew ſo terrible, that Horſe-fleſh was counted dainty Victuals: The Poor

ſtole fat Dogs to eat them, yea ſome, compelled with hunger, are their own Children, and others ſtole their Neighbours Children to eat them: Thieves in Priſon kill'd and tore in pieces thoſe that came newly in, and greedily devoured them half alive: As for Cows, Sheep, Goats, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> they were generally rotten and corrupted by eating the Graſs, which was infected as it grew, ſo that thoſe who eat of them were poiſoned.</p>
            <p>But neither theſe woful Viſitations, nor the innu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merable diſhonours, afflictions and diſcontents under which the Nation lay, had any influence upon the King or his Miniſters, which gave encouragement to one John Poydras a Tanner's Son at Exeter, to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt a very daring Enterprize, he boldly affirming himſelf to be the truly begotten Son of the laſt King Edward the firſt, and ſaid, That he was changed in his Cradle by his Nurſe for a Carter's Child, offering divers colourable Allegations to prove the ſame, and among the reſt, he ſtrongly inſiſted upon the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>princely and unworthy qualities and actions of the King, ſuch as none could be guilty of that was not of a mean, ſordid, and obſcure Birth and Deſcent. His confident Claim, and daring Aſſertions, quickly af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected the Minds of the common People, ſo that many gathered to him and acknowledged him for their King: But at length he was apprehended, and having confeſt his Treaſon, he was Condemned and Executed for his folly near Northampton, declaring that he did it by the motion of a Familiar Spirit, whom he had ſerv'd three years in the likeneſs of a Cat. About the ſame time divers notorious Thieves and Robbers, near two hundred in number, being all clothed like Grey Friers, robbed, and murdered, and deſtroyed the Inhabitants of the North-Countrey, without regard to Quality, Age or Sex; but ſome Forces being ſent againſt them, took the greateſt part, who were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervedly Executed for the ſame.</p>

and grow more dangerous, they, like good Phyſicians, determined to ſearch narrowly into the Cauſes of all theſe Maladies, and to provide ſome Remedy for their Redreſs before it were too late; and the miſerable Oppreſſions and Violencies daily committed in their view, made them take courage to inform the King, That the two Spencers by their Miſmanagement and ill Conduct in the Affairs of State, of whom alone the King took Advice and Counſel, were the immediate and only occaſion of all thoſe Calamities and Misfortunes which now mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerably afflicted and diſturbed the whole Kingdom; and plainly told him, That they had ſo great an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt in the King's Perſon and Government, that they judged themſelves bound in Honour and Conſcience to inform his Highneſs of all ſuch Miſdemeanours a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Theſe ſtrange proceedings of the King, together with the notorious Injuries and Abuſes which they daily ſuffered by the return and advancement of the two Spencers, who now defied their utmoſt Power, ſcorning and deriding them with the moſt pungent Affronts, were ſufficient Warnings to the Lords to take timely care of their Safeties: Wherefore ſince neither Petitions, Submiſſions, nor any other Legal procedure could procure any Remedy of their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated Wrongs, they raiſed a ſtrong Army, and marcht into the Field, and the King with the two Spencers, and ſome few of the Nobility did the like. Before any Action between them, this odd Accident happened, procured, as was thought, by the Contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance of the King, or his Evil Miniſters. A certain Knight belonging to John Earl Warren, ſtole away the Wife of Thomas Earl of Lancaſter, one of the Chief of the Lord's Party, from his Houſe at Caneford in Dorſetſhire, and with great Pomp carried her To E. Warren's Caſtle at Rygate in Surrey, in deſpight of her I, and Huſband, where one Rich. Maurice a wretched

lame, deformed Dwarf, challenged her for his Wife, pretending he had been formerly Contracted to her, and that he had lain with her. The Counteſs though the nobleſt and richeſt Inheritrix of that Age, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed his Allegations, openly declaring to her im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortal infamy, that what he ſaid was true and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by acknowledging her ſelf to be an impudent Strumpet. Upon which this deformed Elf (being incouraged by ſome great Perſons) had the confidence to lay claim to the Earldoms of Lincoln and Salisbury in her Right, and the Honour of this great Earl was blaſted by a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bauched Woman.</p>
            <p>This unhappy paſſage increaſed the fatal averſion between him and the King, and the Earl, and Humfry Bohun Earl of Hereford, having likewiſe received ſome damage from the Spencers, theſe two allured al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt all the reſt of the Nobility to join with them. So that being now gotten into Arms they marched with Banners diſplay'd under the command of the Earl of Lancaſter, whom they conſtituted their General, and after many ſharp skirmiſhes and encounters, the Armies met at Burton upon Trent, where both Parties fought with ſuch obſtinate deſire of revenge, that he was reckoned the moſt valiant man who drencht his Sword deepeſt in Blood. The Nobles now forgot that they fought againſt their Sovereign Lord, and the King would by no means acknowledge, that his Tyranny and Miſgovernment had compelled them to take Arms. Now neither Kindred, Alliance, Neighbourhood, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, Country, nor any other obligation had the leaſt power over their inraged minds. Nothing but death and wounds muſt determine the controverſie between them. At length when many of the Lords, and thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands of their Adherents were ſlain, they fled, and were purſued by the King, the Earl of Hereford wa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>The occaſion of this great defeat of the Barons is attributed in ſome meaſure to an unhappy accident a while before. For Queen Iſabel, who upon all occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions uſed her utmoſt intereſt to procure a right under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding between the King and the Peers, coming from Canterbury to the Caſtle of Leeds in Kent, where ſhe deſigned to lodge that Night, was denied entrance by Lord Badleſmere one of the Earl of Lancaſter's Party, wherewith ſhe was ſo offended, that ſhe made great complaint thereof to the King, who glad of any opportunity to be revenged of the Barons, came in Perſon with a very ſtrong Party before the Caſtle, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of the Queen Friends, who were formerly on, the other ſide joining with him. The Lord himſelf was gone with the reſt of the Noblemen to deſtroy the Lands and Eſtates of the two Spencers, having left his Wife and Children in the Caſtle, and a Captain to command there. After ſome time ſpent in the Siege, the Beſieged finding little hope of relief were forced to ſurrender it to the King at Mercy, who hanged five or ſix of the principal Perſons. And committed the Lord Badleſmere's Wife and Children to the Tower. After which many of the Barons miſdoubting their ſtrength, deſerted their Chief the Earl of Lancaſter, which now made the Victory the more eaſily incline to the King.</p>
            <p>The third day after the Battle, the King reſolving to take his full ſwing of Vengeance upon the Barons, ſate in Judgment in Perſon at Pomfret Caſtle, together with the Earls o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Before whom the Earl of Lancaſter and the reſt being brought, Sentence was pronounced againſt them to be drawn, hanged, and quartered as guilty of High Treaſon, by Andrew Harkley a man of ſmall fortune, but made Earl of Carlile, and Lord Chief Juſtice, for taking the Earl of Lancaſter and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral other Lords Priſoners after the late Fight. The Earl of Lancaſter being the King's Uncle was only Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>headed the ſame day at Pomfret, but the other Lords
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:57822:16"/>
were hanged and quartered in ſeveral parts of the Realm. As the Lords Liſle, Touchet, Manduit, Brad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burn, Fitz Williams, Cheyney at Pomfret. The Lords Clifford, Mowbray and Deynvile hang'd in Chains at York. The Lord Gifford at Gloceſter. The Lord Teys at London. The Lord Aldenham at Wind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſor, and the Lords Badleſmere and Aſhburnham at Canterbury. And ſeveral other Baronets, Knights, Eſquires and Gentlemen were executed in other places. Never before did Engliſh Earth at one time drink up ſo much Blood of her Nobility and Gentry ſhed in ſo vile a manner, which whatſoever was pretended, was reckoned by the People to be ſpilt upon the account, and in the quarrel of the two Ravenous Favourites the Spencers, nor was it long unrevenged with the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of the principal Actors. After this the King likewiſe ſeized all their Eſtates as forfeited to the Crown.</p>
            <p>This havock being made of the Nobility to the aſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment of the reſt, and the terror of the Vulgar, the Spencers were elated ſo intolerably with Pride by this Victory, that inſtead of making good uſe thereof, and reforming thoſe abuſes that might occaſion the like again, and giving the King good Counſel, they now proceed to commit greater Rapines and Violences than before, making their Will a Law in all things. And then preſuming that all affairs ſhould for the future be managed according to their pleaſure, they adviſe the King to call a Parliament at York, in which he created Edward his eldeſt Son Prince of Wales and Duke of Acquitain, He alſo created Sir Hugh Spencer the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Earl of Wincheſter, and Sir Hugh the Son Earl of Gloceſter. And exacted the ſixth Penny of all Mens Eſtates and Goods to ſupport his intended Wars a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Scots, the levying of which Tax cauſed much murmuring and diſcontent among the People, who affirmed, That they were already totally impoveriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and ruined by War, Famine, and the diſordere<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>The King was fully perſuaded that his late Succeſſes had rendered him as terrible to the Scots as to his own Subjects, and that they were no way capable of reſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſo great a Power as he had raiſed againſt them, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolving now to call them to a ſtrict account for all their Inroads, Murthers and Robberies. The Scots being ſecretly inform'd that King Edward was intended to Invade their Country, and to revenge thoſe wrongs he had received from Robert Bruce their King endeavour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to divert him by landing a great Army in Ireland, but the King having timely notice of their deſign, made ſuch proviſion that the greateſt part of the Aſſailants were ſlain, and the reſt fled to their Ships and return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſhamefully to their own Country.</p>
            <p>The King after this marched with a very gallant Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my into Scotland, and being arrived the Scots Nobi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity with ſome thouſands of men pretended to give him Battel, but intended nothing leſs: For at his approach they retired in good Order into the Woods, Foreſts and Mountains of their Country, inſomuch that the Engliſh were quite tired, and diſpirited in purſuing them through thoſe difficult and uneaſie paſſages, ſo that in a ſhort time for want of Proviſions and Neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, and by reaſon of the Rains, Hail, Snow and Froſts, which are incident to that cold Region, the King's Forces were ſo afflicted with Sickneſs and Mortality, that they were obliged to retire without having per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed any thing ſuitable to ſuch mighty preparations. Which when the Scots perceived they purſued them with much cruelty, and one night aſſaulted them with ſo much fury that the King himſelf very narrowly eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caped, and finding his Forces broken, and his Army ſcattered, he was forced to ſave his Life by an igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minious flight, and to leave behind him his Treaſure, Ordnance, Tents and Furniture, a joyful prize to the Victorious Scots</p>
            <p>This laſt diſaſter and danger was occaſioned prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally by the Treachery of Sir Andrew Harkley the new made Earl of Carlile, who under pretence of mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

And this Treaſon thou didſt wilfully commit, for a great ſum of Gold and Silver which thou didſt receive from James Dowglas a Scot, and the King's Enemy.

Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter which the Judg proceeded thus, <q rend="margSglQuotes">'Andrew, thou art now no Knight but a Knave, and for thy Treaſon the King hath appointed that thou ſhalt be hanged, thy Head ſmitten off and placed on London Bridg, thy Bowels taken out and Burnt, thy Body quartered, and thy four Quarters ſet up in four principal Cities of England for an example to ſuch heinous Offenders.</q> And this Sentence was accordingly executed upon him.</p>
            <p>Thus ended this unfortunate expedition to the great reproach and loſs of the Engliſh, and the ſcandal of the King who was grown ſufficiently infamous already for

making the Kingdom a ſhambles for the Nobility. Yet in the midſt of theſe calamities the two Spencers rid Triumphant in the Chariot of Favour, Power, Honour, and Riches, enjoying great part of the Eſtate of the late unfortunate Earl of Lancaſter, and in this gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deur they continued for the ſpace of five years, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding the utmoſt efforts of their potent, and numerous adverſaries, who continually meditated their deſtruction.

            <p>And it did appear that theſe evil minded and vile men, working upon the King's inclination, were the principal Authors and Adviſers of that ſharp revenge taken upon the Lords for their own ambitious, and avaritious ends, whereby at length they brought in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>evitable ruin upon the Crown, Dignity and Life of their Soveraign.

Self and Son, declaring that if ſhe would return to England with the aid of only a thouſand valiant men at Arms, they would raiſe ſo great a ſtrength here to join them, as ſhould make the Spencers feel the ſmart of their unſufferable follies.</p>
            <p>The Queen was exceedingly rejoiced with the hopes of her fortunate ſucceſs. But the two Spencers much doubting the event if ſhe ſhould return with Forces, and having the Treaſure of the Kingdom at command, they corrupted King Charles and his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil with ſuch prodigious ſums of Gold and Silver, and of Rich Jewels: that not only all ſuccour was denied her, but the French K. reprimanded her very ſharply for having ſo undutifully and imprudently forſaken her Lord and Dear Husband. Yea the Pope likewiſe (and many of the Cardinals) being ingaged with rich Preſents by the Spencers, required King Charles under the Penalty of Curſing to ſend the Queen and Prince to King Edward.

            <p>In the mean time King Edward and his profligate Favourites having intelligence of their Intentions, he ſent to demand his Wife and Son to be returned home, but not ſucceeding, and the Spencers knowing that if an happy Agreement ſhould have been made between the King, his Queen, and the Barons, they muſt both have been made Sacrifices of Peace-Offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, to appeaſe the reſentments of the People; they therefore reſolve to make the Breach irreconcileable, by perſuading the King to proclaim the Queen and Prince, with all their Adherents, Traytors and Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies to the King and Kingdom; baniſhing all that he thought were well-affected to them, and keeping a ſevere Eye over the diſco<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>While the Queen continued in Heynault, ſhe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded a Marriage between the Prince then about fourteen years old, and the Lady Philippa that Earl's Daughter, and with the Money of her Dowry Liſted Souldiers in Germany, and ſoon after with three hundred Knights and gallant Warriours, and about 1700 Common Souldiers, Germans and Engliſh, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded by the Earl of Heynault, with the Earls of Kent, Pembroke, the Lord Beumont, and many other Engliſh-men of Quality, ſhe ſafely arrived at Orwell in Suffolk: Upon the firſt Intelligence of their Land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, the Lords and Barons, with joyful hearts, and numerous Troops of reſolute Gallants compleatly Armed, repaired to her Aſſiſtance with all ſpeed, ſo that her Forces hourly increaſed.</p>
            <p>Her Arrival being reported to the King, He poor Prince was ſo ſurprized, that he knew not what courſe to take, being as deſtitute of Friends, and Means to defend himſelf, as he was of Courage and Counſel: However, he requeſted Aid of the Citizens of London, whoſe Anſwer was, That they would honour with all duty the King, Queen, and Prince their Son, who was lawful Heir to the Kingdom, but that they would ſhut their Gates againſt all Foreigners, and Traytors to the Realm, and with all their Powers withſtand them; but that they were not obliged to go out of their Ctiy to fight, no farther than that (according to their Liberties) they might return home again before Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſet. This uncertain Anſwer ſo diſcouraged the King, that he reſolved to withdraw from the City to the Marches of Wales for the preſent levying of an Army, attended with his inſeparable Favourites the two Spencers, and Robert Baldock Biſhop of Norwich, their intimate Friend. Before he went he ordered the Tower of London to be fortified, which he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to the Cuſtody of Sir John Weſton, who was well provided with Men and Victuals, leaving alſo to

his care his younger Son, called Lord John of Eltham, with the counteſs of Gloceſter, the King's Niece, Wife to the younger Spencer, and gave the Government of the City to Walter Stapilton, Biſhop of Exeter (a Creature of the Spencers) his chief Treaſure; and cauſed a Proclamation to be publiſhed, enjoyning all his Subjects to oppoſe, kill, and deſtroy all the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers with the Queen, her ſelf, her Son, and the Earl of Kent his half Brother only excepted. On the other ſide, the Queen made Proclamation, That no Perſon whatſoever ſhould receive any hurt or damage from her Army, but only thoſe two notorious Miſcreants the Spencers, Biſhop Baldock Lord Chancellor, and their Aſſociates; and that ſhe came over for no other end, but to bring to condign puniſhment thoſe noto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Traytors and Miſleaders of the King, promiſing a thouſand pound to any who ſhould bring her the Head of the younger Spencer.</p>
            <p>The King had no ſooner took his laſt leave of the City, and thereby of his Crown and Dignity, but the Londoners ſcorning to ſubmit to their proud and inſolent Governour, apprehended Stapilton, and two of his Servants, and without any Tryal or Judicial proceeding beheaded them at the Standard in Cheapſide, with one John Marſhal a Citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zen and Friend of the Spencers: They likewiſe ſurprized the Tower, killing all that oppoſed them, and declared Lord John the King's Son, Keeper of the City, ſecuring that and the City for the uſe of the Queen and the young Prince: All Priſoners throughout the Kingdom were likewiſe ſet at liberty, and all Fugitives, and baniſhed Men recalled, which much augmented the Queen's Power.</p>
            <p>The King hearing of this Revolt, altered his pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe of raiſing Forces: But whither could this poor Prince flie? What courſe could he take for his own ſafety? who, to gratifie a few profligate Miſcreants, had made his Wife, his Son, his Nobility, and his People, his avowed Enemies: At length he conclad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed

to flie to Briſtol, which he fortified as ſtrongly as he was able, giving the Government of the Town to the Earl of Arundel, and Hugh Spencer the Elder, himſelf with the younger Spencer retiring into the Caſtle, which they reſolved to defend to the utmoſt.</p>
            <p>The Queen marched from Oxford to Gloceſter in her way to Briſtol, which ſhe deſigned to beſiege, her Forces increaſing all the way: The Earls of Leiceſter and Marſhal, the Lords Peircy, Wake, and other Noblemen both from Wales and the North, with the Biſhops of Hereford, Ely and Lincoln, and a great number more of Barons, Knights and Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, coming in to her Aſſiſtance: With this great Army ſhe arrived at Briſtol, and beſieged it: The City was taken in a few days, with the Elder Spencer the Governour, whom the Queen, at the earneſt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity of the common People commanded to be hanged without examination, in his Armour on the common Gallows without the City, and then cut down alive, his Bowels taken out and burnt before his Eyes, his Head cut off, and then his Body hanged up again by the Feet; and after, having four days hung a miſerable ſpectacle to all Beholders, his Body was cut all to pieces, and given to the Dogs to eat, and his Head ſet upon Wincheſter Caſtle.</p>
            <p>The King, the younger Spencer, and Biſhop Bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dock, much diſtruſting their ability to defend the Caſtle, retired from thence ſecretly in the night, and getting into a ſmall Fiſher-boat, determined to flie in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Iſle of Lundy, in the mouth of the River Severn, about two Miles in length, and as many broad, ſtored with Rabbits, Pigeons, and other Fowls, incompaſſed with the Sea, and having only one paſſage into it, ſo narrow, that two Men can ſcarce go abreaſt: But Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Providence ſeemed to withſtand their purpoſe, as deſigning them to be brought to Juſtice; ſo that every day for a week or more, when they attempted to Row their Boat thither, the Wind and Waves drove it back again toward the Caſtle, which being at
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:57822:20"/>
length perceived by the Lord Beumont, he chaſed the Fiſher boat with a ſmall Veſſel, and boarding it, found therein the King, young Spencer, and Baldock, whom they ſo much deſired, and brought them to the Queen, who cauſed them to be carried and ſet in ſight of the Beſieged in the Caſtle, which was ſtill defended by Hugolin, Grandchild to the Elder Spencer, with much courage; and now finding no hope of relief, ſurrendred it upon condition to have his own and his Companions Lives ſaved.</p>
            <p>Some Authors write, That the King going into a Veſſel out of Briſtol Caſtle, deſigned to flie into Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land; and that after he had wander'd a week upon the Sea, Sir Thomas Blount, one of his Friends for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaking him, and going to the Queen, he came aſhoar in Glamorganſhire, where with his few Friends he intruſted himſelf with the Welſh, who had ſtill a kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs for him: The King not appearing, Proclamation was made, That the Barons and People deſired his return to the Exerciſe of the Government, provided he would remedy what was amiſs: Whereupon Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Earl of Lancaſter, Brother to the late Earl, Sir William Zouch, and Rice ap Howel, who had all Lands in Wales, were ſent with Money and Forces to diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver him, which ſo prevailed upon the Welſh-men, that they delivered him up, together with the younger Spencer, Baldock, and one Simon Reading (and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived a Reward of 2000 pound) They were brought to the Queen, who was then at Hereford with Adam Tarlton the active Biſhop, The King was conveyed by the Earl of Lancaſter to Kennelworth Caſtle. After which the Queen and Prince, attended by the Barons and a ſtrong Army marched toward London, carry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with them young Spencer in Chains, like a Slave, before whom certain pitiful Fidlers, and other Varlets ſcornfully played upon Pipes made of Reeds, skiping, dancing and ſinging through every Town as they paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed along. Spencer and Simon Reading, another evil inſtrument, were ſentenced to Death by the Judge
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:57822:21"/>
Sir William Truſſel as Traytors. Spencer in his Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour was with all manner of ſcorn and inſults from the People, drag'd to a Gallows ſet up on purpoſe fifty foot high, where being hanged, he was afterward cut down and beheaded, and quartered. His head ſet upon London Bridge, and his Quarters in four principal Towns of the Kingdom. Simon Reading was hanged ten foot lower on the ſame Gallows, and Robert Bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dock was committed Priſoner to Newgate, where with grief and hard uſage he ſoon after died. This hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened in 1326.</p>
            <p>Thus Divine Vengeance purſued theſe two ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious and profligate Wretches the Spencers Father and Son, and brought thoſe who ſet at defiance the Nobi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, Gentry, and People of the Realm, to ſuch ſhame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and ignominious deaths, as by their vile actions they had juſtly merited. Since by their leud and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſligate Counſels, they prevailed upon the King to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit all manner of Enormities, by forſaking the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany and Bed of his lawful Wife, and living in all manner of debauchery with common Strumpets. By deſtroying and ruining his Nobility and Gentry, by all manner of Rapines upon the Common People, by ſuffering their Enemies to Plunder and Beggar them without any redreſs, and by all other miſdemeanors, which rendred him odious to his Subjects, and made him rule rather like a Tyrant than a King. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by occaſioned his Depoſition and Death, which ſoon after followed.</p>
            <p>For the Queen having ſummoned a Parliament, it was by General conſent of the three Eſtates conclud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, That King Edward ſhould reign no longer, but his Son the Prince ſhould be advanced to the Throne. The Archbiſhop of Canterbury Preaching a Sermon, and taking for his Text this Maxim, Vox Populi Vox Dei, The Voice of the People, is the Voice of God, Exhorting all his Auditors to Pray to the King of Kings, to bleſs and proſper the King that they had Elected. The Queen ſeemed very ſorrowful and even diſtract<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:57822:21"/>
at her Husband's depoſition, and the P. lamented for his Mothers grief, ſwearing that he would not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept of the Crown without his Father's conſent. To content them both, Commiſſioners are ſent to the King who perſuaded him to make a formal Reſignation of the Government, and then his Son was Crowned King. And not long after the Father being removed to Corf Caſtle was barbarouſly murdered by his Keepers, who through a horn run a burning hot Spit into his Funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, of which he inſtantly died. I ſhall add no more having already given a particular account of his Reſignation and Death in a Book called Admirable Curioſities and Rarities in every County in Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, &amp;c.</p>

            <p>SUCH is the Malignity of Humane Nature, that though there are daily examples of Divine Venge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance executed upon notorious Offendors, yet men con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue to perpetrate the ſame crimes that plunged their Predeceſſors into miſery and ruin. Of this, Roger Mortimer is an obvious inſtance, who though he were an Eye-witneſs of the fatal fall of the three unfortunate Favourites, Gaveſton and the two Spencers, with di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers of their Aſſociates in the former Reign: Yea though he himſelf was very inſtrumental in their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction, and very active in pretending to reform the Grievances of the Kingdom: Yet no ſooner was King Edward by his means depoſed, and a young Prince ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:57822:22"/>
to the Throne under the Government and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagement of his Mother, but he by managing the Queen, occaſioned many miſchiefs not much inferior to thoſe of the former abhorred Minions, yea exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their wickedneſs in one point, namely, in being criminally concerned with the Queen Dowager, that being one of the Articles the Parliament charged him with. But as he wilfully diſregarded theſe warnings, and impudently committed the like faults, ſo the Juſtice of Heaven viſited him with the ſame deſerved puniſhment.</p>
            <p>He was deſcended from Roger called the Great Lord Mortimer of Wigmore in the Marches of Wales, who was his Grandfather, and revived and erected again the Round Table at Kennelworth after the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient Order of King Arthur's Table, with the Retinue of an hundred Knights and 100 Ladies in his houſe, for the entertaining of ſuch Adventurers as came thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther from all parts of Chriſtendom. This young Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger inherited his Eſtate and Grandeur. And Queen Iſabel Wife to King Edward II. and Daughter to Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lip the Fair King of France, being in the glory of her youth forſaken by the King her Husband, who delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed only in the company of Peirce Gaveſton his Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion and Favourite, ſhe fell paſſionately in love with this Lord Wigmore, though before ſhe was accounted the moſt virtuous, chaſt and excellent Lady of that Age.</p>
            <p>After the ignominious, but deſerved death of Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſton, the King inſtead of being reformed was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently infatuated with the love of two others, the Spencers Father and Son, who were as bad if not worſe than he, for all manner of leudneſs and debau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chery. Whereupon the Earls of Lancaſter, Hereford, Warwick, Lincoln and others, riſe in Arms againſt them, they having taken an Oath to King Edward I. on his death bed to oppoſe and withſtand his Son Edward if he ever recalled Gaveſton from Exile; and finding that his death had not much bettered the ſtate
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:57822:22"/>
of the Kingdom, they thought themſelves obliged by the ſame Oath to endeavour the ruin of them alſo, and thereby, the redreſſing the many oppreſſions and violencies under which the Nation groaned. This Roger Lord Wigmore a man of an invincible Spirit and his Uncle Roger Mortimer the Elder re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved to join with the Lords in this attempt, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing very buſie in raiſing Forces, were taken before they could muſter them, and by the King committed to the Tower of London. But the Queen by means of Torlton Biſhop of Hereford, Beck Biſhop of Dur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham and Patriarch of Jeruſalem, then both Mighty Men in the State, prevailed ſo far with the King that upon the ſubmiſſion of the Mortimers the King was ſomewhat pacified. But afterward when He had gained a great Victory againſt the Barons, the young Lord Wigmore and his Uncle were condemned to be Drawn and Hang'd at Weſtminſter, and the day of Execution was appointed. Whereupon the Younger Spencer ſome time before, pretended to make a great Feaſt in honour of his Birthday, inviting thereunto Sir Stephen Seagrave, Conſtable of the Tower, with the reſt of the Officers belonging to the ſame, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter he had made them very merry he gave to each a large Cup of a ſleepy Drink prepared by Queen Iſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bel, by which means he made his eſcape, breaking through the Wall of his Chamber, and coming into the Kitchen near the King's Lodgings, and getting in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the top thereof, came into a Ward of the Tower, and ſo with a ſtrong Ladder of Ropes provided by a Friend he got over the Wall, leaving the Ropes faſtened thereunto, which the next day the Specta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors beheld with much aſtoniſhment, conſidering the deſperate danger which he ventured in the attempt. He then ſwam over the Thames into Kent and avoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Highaways came at length to the Seaſide near Portſmouth, where happily meeting with a Ship bound for France, he paſſed over thither, and lived in the French Court ſeveral years. His Uncle Roger was
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:57822:23"/>
detained in a loathſome Priſon five years after, and at length died, and was Buried at Briſtol.</p>
            <p>King Edward was ſo inraged at his eſcape that he turned Sir Stephen Seagrave out of his place of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtable of the Tower, and ſeveral Citizens were ſeized and accuſed of being acceſſary to his getting away, and of correſponding with and maintaining him be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond Sea, but there note being ſufficient proof againſt them, they were all acquitted.</p>
            <p>Mortimer continued in France till Queen Iſabel and the Prince arrived there, to avoid the inſults of the two inſolent Spencers. He after attended the Queen into Germany, and came over with her and the reſt of the Engliſh Lords, accompanied with the Earl of Heynault, and ſeveral German and Engliſh Forces. And upon King Edward's Flight, and afterward his Seizing and Impriſonment, Mortimer preſumed to manage all affairs according to his own pleaſure, and therefore the death of the Spencers, Reading and ſome others not ſatisfying his revenge, being high in the Queens favour who could not deny him the Heads of a few of his Enemies, he procured that the Earl of Arundel and two Gentlemen more, named John Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niel and Thomas Mochelden, (againſt whom he had a particular averſion) ſhould be Beheaded at Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford.</p>
            <p>After this, the Queen, her Son, and the beloved Mortimer went to Wallingford Caſtle, where they kept their Chriſtmaſs with all manner of jollity. From thence they proceeded to London, where the Queen and Prince were received with much Joy, and many rich Preſents, and a Parliament being called, it was concluded that King Edward ſhould be Depoſed and his Son advanced to the Throne. In the manage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment whereof Mortimer diſcovered very much zeal, activity and diligence, as hoping thereby to become Chief Miniſter of State, as well as principal Favou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite of the Queen. King Edward was Depoſed ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly and confined to Kennelworth Caſtle, the
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:57822:23"/>
Queen, Roger Mortimer and Torlton Biſhop of Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford having concluded to allow him an hundred Marks a month for his neceſſary Expences.</p>
            <p>And now it was hoped that the Kingdom, having ſuffered ſo many Concuſſions and Miſeries for ſeveral years, would have been ſettled and reſtored to its for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer peace and tranquility. But it ſoon appeared that though the Nation had changed its Maſter, yet other evil Inſtruments ſucceeded to trouble and diſquiet the already haraſſed People. So that one Hiſtorian writes thus, The beginning of the Reign of King Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward III. was very troubleſome, for he by reaſon of his tender Age being but fifteen years old when he came to the Crown, was drawn aſide by evil Counſel, and committed many foul errors of State and Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment. The chief occaſion of which, were the Queen, her Darling Roger Mortimer, and ſome others.</p>
            <p>For firſt they procured ſo great a part of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venue of the Nation to be ſettled for maintaining the Queen and her Family, that the young King had ſcarce a third part of it for himſelf and his neceſſary Attendants and Officers. So that ſhe and her Favou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite Mortimer lived in the greateſt State and Gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deur imaginable, and the People began to exclaim againſt him and ſay publickly, That the great zeal and hatred he had ſhewed againſt the Rapines of the Spen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers, was not becauſe they had been oppreſſive to the Subject, but that he was deſirous no Body ſhould abuſe them but himſelf.</p>
            <p>Secondly, The Queen and he having intelligence that ſeveral Great Perſons, and the whole Order of Friers Preachers, taking pity of the late King's Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivity, ſeemed to Conſult for his deliverance, and knowing that his Reſtoration would be their confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, they wickedly plotted and contrived to add Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to their former Impieties, and therefore Roger Mortimer was ſent with that ambiguous Order to his
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:57822:24"/>
Keepers, deviſed by Torlton Biſhop of Hereford,
<q>Edwardum occidere nolite tinere bonum eſt.</q>
               <q>
                  <l>To ſhed King Edward's Blood</l>
                  <l>Refuſe to fear I count it good.</l>
               </q>
Where by leaving out the ſtops, they ſufficiently in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged the Murtherers, and yet afterward produced the Writing under Queen Iſabels Seal for their own Juſtification, when the horrid Fact was committed. Though this was very far from clearing them from the guilt of it in the opinion of the Vulgar, whoſe Tongues ſpare none, and who had before heard, that though the Queen in her outward deportment pretended much grief and ſorrow for the Impriſonment of the King her Husband, yet inſtead of viſiting him in his diſtreſs, which he often deſired, as ſtill retaining a very great love for her. She only ſent him fine Clothes and kind Letters, but contrary to the Laws of God and Man refrained from rendring him any Nuptial Duties, which they plainly reported ſhe beſtowed freely enough upon her bloody Adulterer Mortimer. Pretending in the mean time that Reaſons of State would not allow her to converſe with him. And ſoon after this deſolate Prince was by an expreſs order from the Young King, wholly procured by them, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved from Kennelworth to Corf Caſtle, and there miſerably deprived of his life.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, In the ſecond year of the young King's Reign, Robert Bruce King of Scotland denounced War againſt him and his Kingdom, which occaſioned the raiſing of a ſtrong Army conſiſting of above fifty thouſand men, with which the King accompanied by the Queen Mother, Roger Mortimer, the Lord of Heynault, John Lord Beumont and many others of the Nobility and Gentry, marched toward the Scots, who had Invaded England. And had ſo happily in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compaſt them in the Wood of Wiridale and Stanhope Park, that the Engliſh ſeemed fully aſſured of Victory.
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:57822:24"/>
Yet by the Treachery of Roger Mortimer, they were not only ſuffered to make a total eſcape without any loſs; but Sir James Dowglaſs in the dead of the Night with 200 Light-Horſe aſſaulted the King's own Pavilion, and had certainly killed him, had not one of his Chaplains (a Valiant Man) ſacrificed his own life in defence of his Soveraign's: Dowglaſs, after this bold attempt, eſcaped back without damage, but not without honour for his daring Courage; this miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortune was afterward charged upon Mortlmer, as deſigning by the death of the King to Uſurp the Crown: The Scots left their Camp entire behind them, wherein the Engliſh found 500 Oxen and Cows ready killed, a Thouſand Spits full of Roaſt-Meat; 500 Caldrons made of Cow-hides new, with the Hair on, full of Fleſh, Boyling over Fires: And Ten thouſand pair of Shoes, made of raw Hides with the Hair outward; All which became a welcome booty to the hungry Engliſh Souldiers.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, After this diſhonourable retreat of the King (who was extreamly grieved to return ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gloriouſly, notwithſtanding the expence of a vaſt Treaſure, and the imminent danger of his own Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon) and juſt before the death of King Robert, who died of the Leproſie, being accounted one of the moſt Valiant Warriors of that Age, as having re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemed his Country from Slavery, and by whoſe loſs it appeared of how much value the Courage and Conduct of a Prince is; yet before he died, by the contrivance of the Queen Mother, Roger Mortimer, and their Adherents ſuch a diſhonourable Peace is made with the Scots, as exceedingly diſpleaſed the whole Kingdom, and in the end proved fatal to the principal actor Mortimer. For at this Treaty the King, then in his Minority, Sealed Charters to the Scots at Northampton contrived by the Queen, her Favourite, and Sir James Dowglas, without the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge or conſent of the Peers of England, whereby that famous Charter called Ragmans Roll, was ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rendred
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:57822:25"/>
to them, with ſeveral Jewels, and among them one of an extraordinary value called the Black Croſs of Scotland, all which were taken from the Scots by the Victorious King Edward I. The Scots Kings were likewiſe freed and diſcharged for ever, from doing homage and fealty to the Kings of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, or from acknowledging them to have any Right or Superiority over that Kingdom: And that all Engliſhmen ſhould forfeit their Lands in Scotland unleſs they went and reſided there, and ſwore Allegi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance to that King; Moreover under pretence of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king reparation for damages, King Robert was obliged to pay the King of England Thirty Thouſand Marks Sterling, which Money was given to Mortimer, as a reward for his procuring this deſtructive and miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chievous Treaty. And to conclude all: David Bruce Prince of Scotland, a Child of Seven or Eight Years Old, and Heir to K. Robert, Married Jane Siſter to K. Edward at Berwick; whom the Scots in deriſion both of the Peace and Marriage ſcornfully nicknamed Jane Make Peace.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, The Queen and Mortimer being ſenſible that ſome of the Principal Nobility diſliked their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings, and hindred their abſolute Government; they reſolved to contrive ſome means for removing them out of the way, and among others Edward Earl of Kent the King's Unckle: To effect this, it is ſaid, Mortimer cauſed a report to be ſpread abroad that K. Edward II. was ſtill alive at Corf-Caſtle, but not to be ſeen in the day time; and to countenance the deceit, for many Nights together there were Lights ſet up in all the Windows of the Caſtle, and an ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance made of Maſquing, Dancing, and other Royal Solemnities, as if for the King's diverſion: This being obſerved by the Countrey People, they confirmed the rumour of the late King's being there, which was ſoon diſperſed throughout England. The Earl of Kent hearing the news, ſent a Preaching Frier to the Caſtle to find out the truth of it; who
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:57822:25"/>
by giving Money to the Porter, was admitted into the Caſtle, lying very privately in his Lodg all day; at night the Porter cauſing him to put off his own Prieſtly Robes, and put on his, the Frier was brought into the Hall where he ſaw, as he imagined, King Edward II. ſitting in Royal Majeſty at ſupper. The Frier re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning to the Earl, aſſured him of the reality of what he had ſeen; whereupon the Earl being diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented, ſwore that he would endeavour by all ways poſſible to deliver his Brother out of Priſon, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtore him to his Throne: To which purpoſe he ingaged ſeveral other Noblemen in the deſign; with the Provincial of the White and Carmelite Friers, the Biſhop of London, and others: This Conſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racy being diſcovered, though it were only a Lye and fancy, the Frier being impoſed upon only, by a King made of Clouts. Yet the Earl of Kent by his words and ſome Letters that were found about him, was condemned as a Traytor, for conſpiring to ſet a dead Man at liberty. But ſo generally was this Noble Lord beloved and honoured, that he ſtood upon a Scaffold at the Caſtle-Gates at Wincheſter, from Noon till five a Clock at Night for want of an Executioner, none being to be found that would behead him, till at length Mortimer ſent for a poor wretched Fellow out of the Jayl, who with much ado, and many blows hack'd his Head from his Body.</p>
            <p>The Malice and Ambition of Mortimer and his Aſſociates, in making ſo little conſcience of ſhedding Royal Blood; with the many other Male-admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrations aforementioned, raiſed inveterate diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents throughout the Kingdom againſt the Inſolent Authors of them. But in the mean time they who reſolved to ſupport their Grandeur in deſpight of Peers and People, ſummoned a Parliament at Not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tingham, where Roger Mortimer appeared in the utmoſt ſplendor and glory, being Created Earl of March, and having greater attendance, and ſtronger
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:57822:26"/>
Guards than the King himſelf; whom he would ſuffer to riſe up to him, and with whom he walked as his Companion, yea went before him with his Officers. He likewiſe very ſcornfully, and inſolently rebuked Henry Earl of Lancaſter the King's Couſin, that without his leave he had taken up Lodgings in the Town ſo near the Queen; and obliged him, with the Earl of Hereford and Effex, to remove their Lodgings, a Mile from Nottingham: This notorious affront cauſed great murmuring among the Noble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, who ſaid publickly, That Roger Mortimer the Queens Gallant and the Kings's Maſter, ſought by all means poſſible to deſtroy all the Royal Blood, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by to Uſurp the Crown and Government; which ſome of the King's Friends being mightily concerned at, endeavoured to make him ſenſible of his dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, ſwearing that if he would eſpouſe their Cauſe they would faithfully aſſiſt him, and ſecure his Perſon.</p>
            <p>The Young King began already to put on ſerious thoughts, and acted the Man much beyond his years; ſo that the Lords ſoon prevailed upon him to join with them in aſſerting his own Authority, which he himſelf ſaw ſo much leſſened by Mortimer's <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> grown Power. He was likewiſe informed that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> was commonly reported the Queen was with Child by Mortimer, to the great diſhonour both of his Mother and himſelf, and to the grief of all his Loyal Subjects: Hereupon he reſolutely ingaged with the Peers, to bring this Miſcreant and his Abettors to puniſhment. In order to which, Robert Holland, who had been long Governour of Nottingham-Caſtle, and knew all the ſecret paſſages, and conveyances therein, was taken into the deſign: Now there was in the Caſtle a private Paſſage cut through the Rock upon which it is built; which was divided into two ways, one opening toward the River of Trent which runs under it, and the other went a great deal far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther under the adjoining Meadows, and was after
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:57822:26"/>
called <hi>Mortimer</hi>'s <hi>Hole:</hi> The King lying one Night without the Caſtle, was conducted by Torch-light through this Paſſage (himſelf and his Valiant At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendants being all well Armed, and their Swords drawn,) till he came to the door of the Queens Bed-Chamber, which the ſecure and careleſs Lords had left wide open: Some of the foremoſt entred the Room (deſiring the King to retire a little that the Queen might not ſee him) and ſlew Sir Hugh Turpington, who oppoſed them, from whom they went towards the Queen Mother, with whom they found Mortimer, both juſt ready to go into Bed, and ſeizing him they led him out into the Hall, whom the Queen followed crying out, <hi>Bel ſilz, bel filz, ayes pitie de gentil Mortimer,</hi> Good Son, Good Son take pity upon the gentle Mortimer: For ſhe ſuſpected the King was there, though ſhe did not ſee him. Then were the Keys ſent for, and all the Caſtle with the Amunition, and Proviſions were delivered up to the King ſo ſecretly, that none without the Caſtle had any knowledge of it but only the King's Friends. This was counted a very daring enterprize in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard that Mortimer had uſually 180 Knights, beſides Eſquires and Gentlemen, as a conſtant Guard for the ſecurity of his Perſon.</p>
            <p>The next Morning early Roger Mortimer and his Accomplices were carried with mighty ſhoutings and rejoycings of the Common People (the poor Earl of Lancaſter, though blind, making up the cry) toward London, and was committed to the Tower: And ſoon after in open Parliament at Weſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minſter, was Condemned by his Peers, without being brought to Tryal, by a Law of Mortimer's own con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triving, whereby the Earls of Lancaſter, Wincheſter, Gloceſter and Kent were formerly out to Death. The following Articles of High Treaſon were laid to his charge.</p>
            <p n="1">1. That he was conſenting to the Murther of the King's Father. 2. That he Treacherouſly occaſioned
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:57822:27"/>
much loſs and diſhonour to the King at Stanhope Park, by procuring the eſcape of the Scots, for which he had received a great Sum of Money. 3. That he cauſed ſeveral Ancient Deeds and Charters to be burnt, wherein the King of Scots was obliged to do homage to the King of England, and had made a diſhonour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Contract between the King's Siſter, and David Bruce King Robert's Son. 4. That he had prodigally and lewdly waſted the King's Treaſures, as well as thoſe of the two Spencers. 5. That he had been an Evil Councellor to the King, and had been too famili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arly converſant with the Queen Mother. All which Articles are ſum'd up in the following ragged Rymes, which might very well have been in Proſe; but for their Antiqutty and brevity, I will here inſert them.</p>
            <p>Five heinous crimes againſt him ſoon were had.</p>
            <l>1. That he cauſed the King to yield the Scot,</l>
            <l>To make a Peace, Towns that were from him got,</l>
            <l>And therewithal the Charter called Ragman.</l>
            <l>2. He by the Scots was brib'd for private gain.</l>
            <l>3. That by his means King Edward of Carnarvan,</l>
            <l>In Berkley Caſtle Treacherouſly was ſlain.</l>
            <l>4. That with his Prince's Mother he had lain.</l>
            <l>5. And finally with polling at his pleaſure,</l>
            <l>Had rob'd the K. and Commons of their Treaſure.</l>
            <p>For theſe Treaſons he was ſentenced to be hanged, and afterward ignominiouſly drawn in a Sledg to Tyburn, the common place of Execution, then called the Elms, and there upon the common gallows was as ignomini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly Executed, hanging, by the King's command, two Days, and two Nights, a publick and pleaſing ſpectacle to the wronged People: There died with him Sir Simon Bedford, and John Deverel Eſq; as well for the expiation of the late King Edward's deteſtable Murther, as in complement, as it were, to ſo great a
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:57822:27"/>
Man's fall, who ſeldom or never periſh without com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany; they ſuffered in 1330.</p>
            <p>The King by the advice of Parliament deprived the Queen of her exceſſive Dowry, allowing her only a Thouſand Pound a Year, and confining her to a Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſtery during Life, but giving her the honour of a viſit once or twice a Year, though otherwiſe judging her ſcarce worthy to live, in regard of her Debauche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries with Mortimer, and her many other heinous practices.</p>
            <p>From the ſudden ruin of this great Favourite Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timer, we may Remark what Inchantments, Honour, Riches, and Power, are to the minds of Men, how ſuddenly, how ſtrangely do they blow them up with contempt of others, and forgetfulneſs of themſelves? And ſurely the frailty, and uncertainty of Worldly felicity is very viſible in this Great Perſon, who when he was drunk as it were with all humane hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs, ſo that he ſeemed to fear neither God nor Man, was ſuddenly overtaken by Divine Juſtice; and brought to utter confuſion, when he leaſt dreamt of it: But it was very equitable, that he who would not take example by the wretched Fate of his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourite Predeceſſors, ſhould himſelf be made an Example by the like ſhameful and Ignominious Death.</p>

            <head>Remarks on the Life of <hi>Henry Stafford Duke</hi> of <hi>Buckingham,</hi> Favourite to King <hi>Richard</hi> the Third.</head>
            <p>TWO Or three conſiderable Remarks do natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally reſult from the following Hiſtory. 1. That Tyrants being but ſingle Perſons could never perpetrate the many miſchiefs which they are uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally guilty of, did they not meet with proper In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments to imploy therein. 2. That the pravity of Mankind is ſo deplorable, that the temptations of Honour and Riches too often prevail upon Men, and ingage them in the moſt vile and deſtructive deſigns. 3. That thoſe who are imployed by Tyrants muſt never boggle not ſtrain at the greateſt Villanies, ſince if they be not as thoroughly wicked as their Maſter he will account them his implacable Enemies, and they are ſubject to be juſtly ruined by his unjuſt and revengeful hand.</p>
            <p>All theſe Maxims ſeem to be verified in the Life, Actions, and Fall of this Great Man, Henry Stafford Duke of Buckinham: He was Son to Humfry Stafford of Brecknock-ſhire in Wales, who was created Duke of Buckingham, and Lord High Conſtable of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, by King Henry VI. Being deſcended from a Daughter of Thomas of Woodſtock, youngeſt Son to King Edward III. His Son ſucceeded him in his Titles and Honour, and was a great Favourite to King Richard III. and very Inſtrumental in adviſing him to his Uſurped Throne, as by the following Relation appears.</p>
            <p>When King Edward IV. died, he left behind him two Sons, Edward his Succeſſor of thirteen, and Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chard Duke of York of eleven years of Age. The
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:57822:28"/>
Young King and his Brother were by their Father's Will committed to the care of the Earl of Rivers the Queens Brother, whom he made Protector of the King during his Minority. The Court was at this time kept at Ludlow in Wales to retain the Welſh in obedience, who began to be unruly, and in the mean time the Earl of Rivers diſpoſed of all Offices and Places of Preferment, which very much diſlatisfied the Duke of Gloceſter Brother to King Edward IV. and Uncle to the Preſent King, who upon his Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's Death poſſed from the North, where he then was, to London, and finding the Queen and her Kindred had the whole Government of affairs about the King, he was very much diſpleaſed, as judging it a main obſtacle to his Uſurpation and and Advancement to the Throne which it ſeems he had long before de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned; for it was reported that the very night where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in King Edward IV. died, one Miſſelbrook came early in the morning to one Potter living in Redcroſs ſtreet near Cripplegate, and told him, that the King was dead. By my Troth man (ſays Potter) then will my Maſter the Duke of Gloceſter be King. For ſurely if he had not been acquainted with his Maſter's Inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions he would not have thus ſpoke. But the Duke knowing that a buſineſs of ſuch conſequence was not to be managed alone, he aſſociated to himſelf the Duke of Buckingham Lord High Conſtable, and the Lord Haſtings Lord Chamberlain of England, two of the moſt powerful men in the Kingdom, prevailing upon the former by promiſing him the Earldom of Hereford, and the other being hereby in hopes to be revenged upon his former Enemies. So that they joined with him in opinion, that it was not neceſſary the Queens Kindred ſhould ſo wholly engroſs the King, and Perſons of better Birth and Nobility ſhould be neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected, and therefore they ought to uſe their utmoſt endeavours to remove them.</p>
            <p>The young King was now coming toward London with a great Attendance of Lords and their Follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:57822:29"/>
in order to his Coronation, which the Duke of Gloceſter judging to be another rub in his way, ſince he could not bring about his purpoſes without ſeeming to make an open War. He thereupon ſends flattering Letters to the Queen, with zealous pretences of Loy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alty and Service, perſuading her to diſmiſs the great Guards about the King, ſince it might raiſe Jealouſies in the Minds of the reſt of the Nobility, that her Kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred did not raiſe theſe Forces for the ſecurity of the King's Perſon, but for ſome Siniſter intent, and might cauſe them to raiſe a ſtrength proportionable to encoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter them, and ſo occaſion a Civil War in the Kingdom, wherein her Kinſmen would by all the World be judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the firſt Aggreſſors.</p>
            <p>Theſe plauſible reaſons had ſuch influence upon the innocent Princeſs, that ſhe ſends poſitive Order to the King and her Brother, inſtantly to diſband their Guards for reaſons beſt known to her ſelf, (without mentioning by whoſe advice) which if ſhe had, they would never have done it, but upon the receipt of theſe Letters they preſently diſcharged the Souldiers, and came on with a very mean Train, and having paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed through Northampton were proceeding to Stony-Stratford twelve Miles from thence, where the Dukes of Gloceſter and Buckingham met them; But they pretending that the Town was too little for them and their Retinue went back to Northampton where the Earl Rivers had taken up his Quarters for that night, intending the next Mornining to follow the King. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Complements paſſed upon their Meeting, and Supper being ended the two Dukes pretend to retire to reſt, and the Earl went to his Lodgings.</p>
            <p>The two Dukes waſted a great part of the Night in conſulting with their Friends how to execute their en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terprize, and having got the Keys of the Inn Gate they ſuffered none to go in or out, of which Earl Rivers having notice, though he ſuſpected miſchief, yet in confidence of his own innocence he went boldly into the Dukes Chamber, where he found the Duke of
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:57822:29"/>
Buckingham and the reſt cloſely contriving their buſineſs, with whom he expoſtulated the unreaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ableneſs of their making him a Priſoner againſt his Will, but inſtead of a reply, they inſtantly command him to be ſeized, accuſing him of divers crimes whereof they themſelves were only culpable, and then putting him in ſafe cuſtody they ride away to the King to Stony Stratford, coming juſt as he was taking Horſe, whom they ſalute with much ſeeming reverence, but preſently begin a quarrel with the Lord Richard Grey the King's half Brother. The Duke of Buckingham giving the King an account, that this Lord, the Marqueſs of Dorſet his Brother, and the Earl Rivers, had contrived and almoſt effected the ingroſſing the management of all the affairs of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom among themſelves, which might be of dangerous conſequence, by raiſing diſcontents among the Nobi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, and diſſention among the People, and that the Marqueſs had taken out of the Tower of London a great quantity of Money and Arms without Warrant, which might juſtly be ſuſpected is not intended for any good end, and that it was therefore thought neceſſary by the Lords and Peers that he ſhould be ſeized at Northampton, ſo to be ready to anſwer what he ſhould be charged with.</p>
            <p>The King not being ſenſible of their deſign, mildly anſwered, What my Brother Marqueſs hath done I cannot ſay, but for my Uncle Rivers and my Brother here, I am well ſatisfied that they are ignorant of any unlawful Practices either againſt me or you. Oh, ſays the Duke of Buckingham, that hath been their policy to conceal their treachery from your Graces knowledge. And thereupon they inſtantly in the King's preſence ſeized the Lord Grey, Sir Thomas Vaughan, and Sir Richard Hall, and carried the King with all his company back to Northampton, turning away all his Old Officers and Servants, and putting thoſe in their rooms who were under their direction, at which harſh uſage the young King wept, and was
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:57822:30"/>
much diſcontented but without remedy. Yet to co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour their intents, the Duke of Gloceſter being at Din<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, ſent a Diſh of Meat from his own Table to the Lord Rivers, biding him he of good cheer for in a ſhort time all would be well. The Earl thanking the Duke, deſired the Meſſenger to carry the Diſh to the Lord Richard Grey with the ſame meſſage for his comfort, as one to whom ſuch troubles were unuſual but for himſelf he had been inured to them all his life, and therefore could the better bear them. But notwithſtanding this pretended kindneſs the Duke of Gloceſter ſent the Earl Rivers, the Lord Grey, and Sir Tho. Vaughan into the North, and afterward to Pomfret Caſtle where they were all in the end behead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by his Order, without Trial.</p>
            <p>The Duke having gotten his Prey in his Clutches, marches with the King toward London, declaring to all People in the way, that the Queens Relations had conſpired to deſtroy the King, and all the antient No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility of the Kingdom, and to ſubvert the Government of the Nation, and that they were taken and impriſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in order to be brought to a Legal Trial. And to make it more probable they carried along with them divers Waggons loaden with Arms, with ſeveral Cheſts, which they themſelves had provided, pretending they were full of Money, which the Conſpirators had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided to pay the Forces they deſigned to raiſe. But the fineſt Intreague of all was, that five of the Dukes own Creatures were brought along in Chains, who in every place where the K. lodged were given out to be Perſons of Quality that had been drawn into this hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rid Plot and Treaſon by the Queens Brother, who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing now very ſenſible of their guilt, had confeſſed the whole of theſe wicked contrivances. This Pageantry was acted all the way till the King came to London, but then the actors were diſcovered, and the cheat was openly detected.</p>
            <p>About midnight of the next day, the Queen had notice of theſe ſorrowful accidents, and now too late
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:57822:30"/>
repented her folly in being ſo treacherouſly impoſed upon by the bloody Duke of Gloceſter, as to diſmiſs the Guards about her Son's Perſon by his inſtigation, and doubting that worſe would follow, ſhe with her young<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Son Richard and five Daughters, takes Sanctuary at Weſtminſter, lodging in the Abbot's Houſe there. The Young King having intelligence of theſe things, with Sighs and Tears expreſt much grief, but the two Dukes made ſo many proteſtations of their fidelity and care of his ſafety that they ſeemed to wonder at his being any way concerned.</p>
            <p>Soon after, the Lord Haſtings ſent a Meſſenger to the Archbiſhop of York, then Lord Chancellor of England to ſignifie to him, that he need not be diſturbed at what happened, aſſuring him that in a little while all would be well again. <hi>I am ſure,</hi> replied the Archbiſhop, <hi>Let it be as well as it will, it will never be ſo well as we have ſeen it.</hi> And preſently after, the Archbiſhop attended by all his Servants armed in the midſt of the Night came to the diſtreſſed Queen, whom he found ſitting alone upon an heap of Ruſhes, much diſconſolate and in Tears, whom he endeavoured to comfort by telling her, That he had good hopes the matter would not be ſo bad as ſhe ſuſpected, the Lord Haſtings having by a Meſſenger ſent on purpoſe aſſured him that all would end well. <q rend="margSglQuotes">'Ah wretch! quoth the Queen, that man is one of thoſe who endeavour to ruin me and my Family: Madam quoth the Biſhop, pray be pacified, for I will ingage that if they dare preſume to Crown any but your Son whom they now have with them, the next day we will Crown his Brother who is here with you. And Madam, I here deliver you the Great Seal which was committed to me by that Noble Prince your Huſband, and which I reſign to you, only for the uſe and benefit of your Son.</q> Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter which he departed, and in his way home obſerved the River of Thames full of Boats, with the Duke of Gloceſter's Servants, watching to prevent any from
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:57822:31"/>
going into Sanctuary without being firſt ſearcht and examined.</p>
            <p>Theſe proceedings were very diſtaſtful to many of the Nobility and Citizens, doubting that all this was intended againſt the King's Perſon, and to prevent his Coronation. Whereupon they went armed about the ſtreets, and met together to conſult of the common ſafety. But the Lords of the Council being aſſembled, the Archbiſhop of York fearing that he ſhould be charged with want of underſtanding for delivering the Great Seal to the Queen, without the King or Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils leave, he privately ſent for it again, which being returned, he brought it as uſually into Council. The Lord Haſtings, whoſe fidelity to the King was real, aſſured the Lords that the Duke of Gloceſter was faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and loyal to his Prince, and that the Lord Rivers and Lord Richard with the other Knights were ſecured for ſome ſecret practices againſt the Dukes of Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſter and Buckingham, and that the King ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive no damage thereby, and that they ſhould con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue Priſoners no longer than till the whole matter was throughly examined before the King and Council. He therefore adviſed the Lords not to judge of it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they had heard it, nor to turn their private grudges and quarrels into publick contentions, and thereby diſturb the King's Coronation, which might be of worſe conſequence than they could at preſent imagine. For the Dukes were now coming to Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don to that purpoſe, and if the Lords ſhould take up Arms to oppoſe them, they would be counted Rebels. Since having the King in their Hands they would pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend his Authority to declare them ſo to be. By theſe Arguments, ſome of which he knew to be true, and others not, but chiefly by the near approach of the two Dukes to the City, theſe commotions were paci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied.</p>
            <p>At the King's approach, the Lord Mayor, Alder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men and Sheriffs of London with five hundred Horſe went as far as Hornſey to wait upon him, and attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:57822:31"/>
him from thence to London, where he arrived May, 4. 1483. And was Lodged in the Biſhop's Palace: A great Council was then held, and the Dukes of Gloceſter and Buckingham, with the reſt of the Lords preſent, ſwore Allegiance to the King, and the Duke of Gloceſter carried himſelf ſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpectfully to him, that all the former jealouſies of his deſigning foul play vaniſhed, and he gained ſuch reputation and credit with the Council; that by their general conſent and approbation he was choſen Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tector of the King and Kingdom. And thus was the Innocent Lamb delivered into the Cuſtody of the Ravenous Wolf: The Council ſeverely check'd the Archbiſhop of York for ſo inconſiderately delivering the Great Seal to the Queen, which was now taken from him, and given to Dr. Ruſſell Biſhop of Lincoln, one of the Honeſteſt and Learnedſt Men of that Time: Several Knights and Gentlemen had Places beſtowed upon them, but the Lord Haſtings kept his Office of Lord Chamberlain as formerly, and ſo did divers others.</p>
            <p>The Duke of Gloceſter knowing he could not finiſh his miſchevious purpoſes, without having the other Son Richard Duke of York in his hands; for without them both he was as good have had nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: Therefore as his actions had made the King Melancholly, he now pretends that he ought to have his Brother's company to make him merry; and at the next meeting of the Lords of the Council he repreſented to them, That it was a very heinous <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

him from Enemies or Poyſon, but in procuring for him ſuch recreations and pleaſures as were ſuitable to his Youth and Dignity, and which he could not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy ſo properly in the company of Grave Councellors or Ancient Perſons, as in that of his own Dear Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: He therefore adviſed, that the Archbiſhop of York might be ſent to perſuade the Queen to deliver her Son out of Sanctuary, which would be ſo much to the advantage of the Young Duke the King's moſt Noble Brother, and after his Soveraign Lord him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, his moſt Dear Nephew, and might alſo prevent any ſiniſter thoughts of the People, concerning the Nobility and Council. But if ſhe continued obſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate, and would not hearken to the Archbiſhop's Councel in this matter, that then by the King's Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty he ſhould be forcibly taken from her, and brought to his Royal preſence, where he ſhall be ſo honour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably received and treated, that the World ſhall be convinced it was only the malice, frowardneſs, and folly of his Mother which occaſioned his being kept in Priſon ſo long already.</p>
            <p>This ſubtil Speech had ſuch effect upon the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil that they all concluded the motion to be juſt and reaſonable: And likewiſe comfortable and honour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able both to the King and his Brother, and would pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent Evil ſurmiſes, provided the Queen could be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced quietly to deliver him. The Archbiſhop un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertook to uſe his utmoſt endeavours to incline her to it, but added, if ſhe perſiſted in refuſing it, he thought it was not to be attempted againſt her will, for it would turn highly to the diſhonour of God, and to the diſpleaſure of the People, if the priviledge of that Holy place ſhould be now broken, which had ſo many Years been inviolably preſerved, which ſo many good Kings and Princes had granted and confirmed; and which Holy Ground was 500 Years ago by St. Peter in his own Perſon accompanied with great numbers of Angels by Night, ſo miraculouſly hallowed and Dedicated to God: And for proof
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:57822:32"/>
whereof they have St. Peter's Copy yet in Weſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minſter Abbey to ſhow; and from that time to this, there was never any King ſo indevout and prophane that durſt violate that Sacred place, nor any Biſhop ſo Holy that durſt as to preſume to Conſecrate it; and therefore (quoth the Archbiſhop) God forbid that any Man for any Earthly thing ſhould preſume to break the Priviledges, and Liberties of that Holy Sanctuary, and I hope in God I ſhall not need to fear it, for my utmoſt endeavours ſhall not be want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
            <p>The other Biſhops and Clergy in the Council were of the ſame opinion, that no violence ought by any means to be uſed toward the Queen, or that Sacred Place. The Archbiſhop added, But my Honourable Lords, If the Mothers fears, or Womaniſh dread render my meſſage ineffectual, I hope, I ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive no prejudice in your judgments thereby.</p>
            <p>Womaniſh fear, nay Womaniſh frowardneſs, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied the Duke of Buckingham, for I dare take it upon my Soul, ſhe very well knows there is no juſt cauſe for her to fear any danger can accrue thereby; either to her Son or her ſelf; for ſurely no Man will make War with Women. I would to God that ſome Men of her Family were Women too, and then we ſhould all be quickly quiet: Yet are none of them the leſs reſpected becauſe they are her Relations, but by reaſon of their ill actions; but if we had no kindneſs for her or her Kindred, yet no Man can believe that we have any hatred, or evil deſign againſt the King's Noble Brother who is a Kin to us all, for whoſe Honour and welfare, if his Mother had ſo much regard as we of the Nobility have, She would not ſuffer him any longer to be without his Brother's ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety, nor give occaſion to Men to think that we have any ſurreptitious intentions toward him. For though ſhe be a Wiſe Princeſs, yet I hope ſhe does not ſo preſume upon her own Wit, as to prefer it before the Wiſdom of this Illuſtrious Aſſembly, nor ſuſpect
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:57822:33"/>
any unfair dealing from us, whom ſhe knows to be devoted to the Service both of the K. and his Brother. Her refuſal muſt therefore be the effect of her pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſhneſs, and preverſneſs, and not of her real fears, unleſs ſhe dreads her own ſhadow: Beſides, if upon pretended doubts ſhe is not willing to part with him, we have the greater reaſon to take him out of her hands, leſt to prevent us, ſhe ſhould convey him out of the Kingdom; and it would much reflect upon the diſcretion of this Honourable Council, to ſuffer the King's Brother to be carried out of the Realm be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore our Faces; I am therefore clearly for taking him from her, not that I would have Sanctuary violated, but as I would not break the Priviledges they have ſo long enjoyed; ſo if they were now to be given, I would not be one that ſhould conſent to confirm them.</p>
            <p>I will not deny but it may be neceſſary that thoſe Men whom unfortunate accidents, and not their own ill Huſbandry, have reduced to Poverty, ſhould have a place of ſecurity from their cruel Creditors: Likewiſe, If their be a Contention about the Rights of Princes to the Crown, whereby ſometimes one Party, and ſoon after another are declared Traytors, as it has lately happened; I judge it convenient that there be ſome places of refuge for both: But for Thieves, and eſpecially wilful Murtherers, whom God Almighty commands ſhould be taken from the Altar and put to Death, I know no reaſon that they ſhould have any protection. For if either neceſſity, ſelf de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, or misfortune brings a Man into danger, he is either acquitted by the Law, or the King out of his Clemency has power to grant him a Pardon.</p>
            <p>Now let us conſider, how few Sanctuary men are neceſſitated to go thither, and how great a number their own flagitious crimes drive into them: What a rabble of Thieves, Murtherers, Traytors, and other heinous Offenders ſhelter themſelves from Juſtice, in two Sanctuarys only; The one in the
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:57822:33"/>
Elbow of the City, as I may call it, I mean this at Weſtminſter, the other in the very bowels of it, St. Martins Le Grand; and I dare avow that if we compare the miſchiefs that are occaſioned by them, with the benefits received from them, we muſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude that we were better without both: This I affirm, though they were not abuſed as they are, and having ſo long continued bad, there is now little hope of redreſs, ſince no Man dares preſume to talk of reforming them, and Men thereby ſeeming to make God and St. Peter the Patrons of Profligate and Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious People. For how many live prodigally, and run in debt upon the incouragement of ſecuring them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in theſe places? How many Rich Villains carry in thither Poor Mens Goods, and leave them and their Families to Starve for want of their juſt dues? How many Women run away from their Huſbands, with their Plate and Money, and are there protected, to ſpend it upon their Gallants? How many Robbers bring Stolen Goods thither, and live bravely upon them? there they contrive new Robberies, going out at Night to commit them, and having Stolen, Plun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred, and Murdered, they return thither again with their prey, as if ſuch places gave them not only ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity to perpetrate theſe Villanies, but a Licence to continue them.</p>
            <p>But much of this miſchief might be prevented if good Men would in earneſt put their hands to it, which might tend much to the honour of God, and yet be no breach of Priviledge. For, ſince former Popes and Princes, who were more Politick than Pious, have granted them theſe long immunities; We and others ſince, out of fear have confirmed them, we muſt be content to ſuffer them; and in God's name let them ſtand in force as far as reaſon will permit, but not in ſuch force as to hinder us from taking this Young Prince out of Priſon, and reſtoring him to his Liberty, Honour and Eſtate.</p>
            <pb n="62" facs="tcp:57822:34"/>
            <p>A Sanctuary is to preſerve thoſe Men or Women that are in danger of the Law abroad, but not to wrong nor cheat any body, by going in thither: Now this Prince is in peril by no Law, his Youth and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocence free him from all ſuſpicion of danger, as well as his near Alliance to the King; therefore he neither needs, nor can have any benefit by Sanctu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ary, and I dare ſay, is very angry with thoſe that keep him there: But ſuppoſe the Duke is willing ſo long to continue there, yet it is my opinion that he may be taken from thence againſt his will, as juſtly as a Man may take his Wife, who is run away from him thither, by the Arm and lead her out of St. Peter's Church, without any offence to St. Peter. For if none muſt be taken out of Sanctuary that have a mind to continue there, then if a Child will run thither to prevent his going to School, his Maſter muſt let him alone, and as mean as this inſtance is, yet there is leſs reaſon in our caſe than in that, for that Child has ſome fear, imaginary or real, but this Young Gentleman has none at all.</p>
            <p>To conclude, I have often heard of Sanctuary Men, but never before of Sanctuary Children: Let thoſe Men that deſire and need it have the benefit of it, but he can be no Sanctuary Man that hath not under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding to deſire it, nor malice to deſerve it, whoſe Life nor Liberty can by no Legal proceſs be in Jeo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pardy, and he that taketh one out of Sanctuary for his own advantage and benefit, can never be challenged for a Sanctuary breaker.</p>
            <p>The Duke having ended his long Harangue, all the Temporal and moſt part of Spiritual Lords, not ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the leaſt ſuſpition of any Treachery, were of opinion that if the Young. Duke were not delivered, he ought to be taken away from his Mother; yet to avoid clamour they concluded that the Archbiſhop of York ſhould be ſent to perſuade her, the Protector and Council reſolving to Sit in the Star-Chamber till his return: Thereupon the Archbiſhop with
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:57822:34"/>
divers other Lords accompanying him, went to the Queen in Sanctuary, both out of reſpect to her, and to ſhew by their number that the Council were unani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous in the Meſſage that was ſent her: And ſome were of opinion that the Protector had ſeveral of his Creatures among them, to whom he had given private Inſtructions to ſeize him by force, and bring him away if his Mother ſhould perſiſt in her denial, and thereby prevent her from conveying him to a place of more ſecurity.</p>
            <p>When they came into the Queens preſence, the Archbiſhop acquainted her that the Protector and all the Council had upon mature deliberation concluded that the detaining the King's Brother in Sanctuary, was a thing that might occaſion ſtrange ſurmiſes of them among the People, and ſeemed ſcandalous to them, as well as grievous to the King's Royal Majeſty, to whom the preſence of his Dear Brother muſt needs be as pleaſant and delightful, as the keeping them apart was diſhonourable to her and her Kindred; as though one Brother were in danger of another: That the Council had therefore ſent him and the reſt to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire her delivery of him out of that place; ſo that he might at full liberty and freedom viſit and continue with the King his Brother, and be reſpected and attended according to his High Birth and Quality; the doing whereof would tend to the quiet of the Realm, be very pleaſing to the Council, and advantagious to her ſelf, as well as to her Friends that were now in trouble: And above all (quoth the Archbiſhop) and what. I ſuppoſe you deſire beyond all, it will not only be comfortable and honourable to the King, but to the Young Duke himſelf, whoſe ſingular happineſs it will be to be with his Brother, and to partake in thoſe Princely Sports and Recreations which are ſuitable to their Dignity, and which they cannot ſo properly par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take of in the company of any other. For the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tector eſteems it no ſuch ſlight matter as it may be thought, that the minds of the Young Princes ſhould
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:57822:35"/>
for their Healths, be ſometimes refreſh'd with thoſe diverſions which may be both pleaſant and proper for their Age and Quality.</p>
            <p>My Lord (replied the Queen) I will not deny but it may be very convenient that this young Gentleman you require of me were in the Company of the King his Brother, and in truth I think it might be as ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary that for a while yet, they were both in the Cuſtody and Company of their Mother, their tender age conſidered, but eſpecially the younger, who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides his Childhood hath been lately viſited with a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere ſickneſs, and is yet only amended but not reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered, ſo that it is very fit he ſhould be carefully at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended, and that charge I will commit to no Perſon upon Earth, but reſolve to make it my own buſineſs, conſidering that the Phiſitians tell us, a relapſe is more dangerous than the firſt Sickneſs, for nature be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing before weakned, is leſs able to endure a ſecond Combate, and though it may be others might uſe their beſt ſkill and diligence about him, yet none knows ſo well how to order him as my ſelf, who have ſo long been with him, nor can any be ſo tender of him as his own Mother that bore him.</p>
            <p>None can deny, quoth the Archbiſhop, but that your Grace is of all Perſons the moſt proper about your Children, and the Council would be very glad that you would take care of them, if you pleaſe to do it in ſuch a place as might be convenient and honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable, but if you deſign to continue here, they then think it more proper that the Duke of York ſhould be with the King at liberty and in honour, to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort of them both, than to live here as a Sanctuary man, to their high diſhonour and diſgrace. Since it is not always neceſſary that the Child ſhould be with his Mother, but on the contrary that they be ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated from each other. And of this there is a late inſtance, that when your deareſt Son the Prince, and now King, did for his honour and the ſecurity of the Country reſide at Ludlow in Wales far diſtant from
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:57822:35"/>
your Grace, yet you ſeemed very well contented therewith. Not ſo well contented neither, ſaid the Queen, but the caſe is not now the ſame, for that Son was then in health, and this is now ſick, and therefore I much wonder that my Lord Protector ſhould be ſo deſirous to have him in his company, ſince if the Child ſhould happen to miſcarry he will be ſuſpected of having a hand in his death, and to have uſed foul play toward him. Neither can I but admire that the Council ſhould think it ſo diſhonourable for him to be here, when none can doubt but he will be in ſafety while I am with him, and where by the Grace of God I intend to continue, and not to bring my ſelf into the danger that my Kindred are in, whom I rather wiſh to be here with me in ſecurity. Why Madam, ſaid one of the Lords, do you know that your Kindred are in danger: No verily Sir ſaid ſhe, nor why they are wrongfully Impriſoned, but I ſhall not marvel if thoſe who have thus illegally confined them without reaſon, ſhould proceed to deſtroy them with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Cauſe. The Archbiſhop bid him forbear ſuch diſcourſe, and told her, that he did not doubt but the Lords in Cuſtody would be quickly at liberty, if nothing could be proved againſt them. And that her own Perſon could not be in any peril. The Queen replied, What reaſon have I to believe that, ſince my Kindred are as Innocent as my ſelf, and all the malice againſt us is becauſe we are ſo near a kin to the King. As for the Gentleman my Son, I intend he ſhall be where I am till I ſee farther, for I aſſure you the more earneſt I ſee ſome men to have him away with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any real ground, the more I dread to part with him. And truly Madam, quoth the Archbiſhop, the more loth you are to part with him, the more afraid are other men that you ſhould convey him away, and therefore ſince he can have no privilege that does not aſk it, nor for any fault can want it, they will think it no breach of privilege to take him from you by force.</p>
            <pb n="66" facs="tcp:57822:36"/>

               </gap>r quoth the Queen, hath the Protecter ſo much love and tenderneſs for him, that he only fears he ſhould eſcape him. Alas whither ſhould I ſend him if he be not ſafe in this Sanctuary, the privilege whereof there was never any Tyrant ſo wicked or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viliſh to break. But it ſeems my Son deſerves no Sanctuary and therefore cannot have it: What, is this place of ſecurity for a Thief, and not for an Infant? But he is in no danger, ſay they: I would to God he were not. I wiſh the Protector may prove a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tector to him, but the matter is plain, he hath one Son already in his Hands, and could he get the other, and deſtroy them both, he would then Uſurp the Crown. I ſhall give no other account why I have ſuch a fear, but only what the Law gives, which as Learned men tell me, forbids any man to have the cuſtody of one by whoſe Death he may inherit far leſs than a Kingdom. I ſhall ſay no more, but that who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever breaketh this holy Sanctuary, I pray God he may ſoon have need of one, but not enjoy it.</p>
            <p>The Queen then proceeded in ſevere reflections upon the Protector's deſigns, which the Archbiſhop did not then believe, and was therefore loth to hea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>, but told her in ſhort, That if ſhe would deliver her Son to him and the reſt, he durſt pawn his Soul and Body for his ſafety; but if not, he much doubted ſhe would be obliged to do it againſt her will, and that he would never move her any more in that matter. Theſe words made the Queen ſtand ſilent, and conſidering ſhe had no time or place to ſecure him from them, the Sanctuary being ſtrongly guarded, and that ſhe did believe the Archbiſhop and ſome of the reſt of the Lords were good men, and would not ſee her Child wronged, and finally that if the Protector was reſolv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to have him, he would ſcruple at nothing to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſs his ends, ſhe concluded to deliver him her ſelf to their fidelity, and taking the young Duke by the Hand, ſhe ſaid, My Lords, I neither miſtruſt your prudence, nor am jealous of your faithfulneſs, of
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:57822:36"/>
which I now give you a convincing proof, and where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in if I ſhould be miſtaken, it would be a very great affliction to me, and would bring much miſchief to the Realm, and eternal reproach upon your ſelves. For behold here is the Gentleman you require, whom I doubt not but I could have kept ſafe in this place, whatever is alledged to the contrary. Though I do not queſtion but I have ſome ſuch deadly Enemies to my, Family and Blood abroad, that if they thought they had a drop of it in their own Bodies they would let it out. For we have had many examples that the ambition of Soveraignty makes void all tyes of Kindred and Alliance, for this cauſe Brothers have been the ruin of Brothers, and may the Nephews find better uſage from their Uncle. While theſe Children are apart the life of one is a defence to the other, and their ſafety conſiſts in each others welfare. Keep one ſafe, and that will ſecure the other, but nothing is more dangerous than that they ſhould be in one place, for no wiſe Merchant will venture all his Eſtate in one Ship. But however, here I deliver him, and his Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in him, into your hands, of whom I ſhall require them both, in the ſight of God and the World. I know very well that you are both Juſt and Wiſe, and that you want neither Will nor Power to preſerve them, if you think otherwiſe pray leave him with me. But one thing I earneſtly recommend to you, to be very cautious, leſt while you count me too fearful, you your ſelves be not too fearleſs and ſecure.</p>
            <p>Then turning to the Child, Come my own ſweet Son ſaid ſhe, let me Kiſs you before you go, for God knows whether ever we ſhall kiſs one another again, to whoſe holy protection I commit you. Having Kiſſed and Bleſſed him ſhe turned aſide and wept, and then went away, leaving the Child weeping as faſt as ſhe. The Lords having received the Duke, brought him into the Star Chamber, where the Protector and Council were ſitting. As ſoon as he was entred the room, the Protector riſes up and takes him in his
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:57822:37"/>
Arms, Kiſſing and Imbracing him, ſaying, Dear Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phew you are welcome with all my heart, for next to my Soveraign Lord your Brother, nothing gives me ſo much contentment as your preſence. And herein it was thought he did not diſſemble, having now got the prize which he ſo much deſired. Soon after up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on pretence of removing the two Princes into a place of more ſecurity, till the Peoples minds were ſettled, the Protector cauſed them to be carried in great Pomp and State through London to the Tower, there to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue till the King's Coronation, from whence they never after came abroad.</p>
            <p>The Protector now began more openly to proſecute his deſigns, but the work being great, he muſt make uſe of Great men in it, and at that time none was more potent than that Duke of Buckingham. Some have writ that the Duke was privy to all the contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vances of the Duke, from the death of King Edward IV. Others thought the Protector never durſt adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to diſcover a matter of ſuch great conſequence to him, and that he now imployed ſome cunning people to inſinuate into the Duke that the young King had a ſecret hatred to him for being acceſſary to the Impriſonment of his Kindred, and that if he were ever in a capacity he would revenge it upon him, for if they ſhould be again at liberty to be ſure they would incite him to it, and if they ſhould be put to death, this would the more inrage the King againſt him. That there was no way for the Duke to retreat, or make his Peace with the King, ſince the King himſelf, with his Brother and Kindred were now in ſuch ſafe cuſtody that the Protector with a word of his Mouth could de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy them all, and him alſo, if he found him fall off from his Intereſt.</p>
            <p>Though the Duke might be troubled at what he had done, yet being ſenſible of the Protector's cruelty, and his own danger, he reſolved to join with him in all his trayterous enterprizes, and ſo it was agreed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween them, that the Duke ſhould aſſiſt the Protector
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:57822:37"/>
to advance him to the Crown. In recompence of which ſervice, the Protector's only Son and Heir ſhould marry the Duke's Daughter, and ſhould likewiſe have the Earldom of Hereford ſettled upon him and his Succeſſors, which he had claimed as his Inheritance from Edward IV. but could never obtain it. He alſo promiſed the Duke a large ſum of the King's Money, and a great quantity of his Houſhold-ſtuff.</p>
            <p>Having entred into this curſed combination, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lude the People they pretend to make great prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations for Crowning the young King. To which pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe all the Lords of the Council were ſummoned to appear in the Tower. Where they met accordingly, but the Protector being ſenſible that the Lord Haſtings would be a great obſtacle in his way, becauſe of his firmneſs and fidelity to his old Maſter King Edward's Sons, he reſolved to be rid of him, which he effected in the manner following.</p>
            <p>The Protector coming into Council complemented all the Lords very affably, ſeeming more than ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily merry, and after ſome other diſcourſes, My Lord, ſays he to the Biſhop of Ely, I hear you have very good Strawberries in your Garden in Holbourn, pray let us have a diſh of them: With all my heart replied, the Biſhop, and inſtantly ſent for ſome, The Protector then roſe haſtily up, deſiring them to excuſe his ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence for a while. And returning about an hour after, he appeared ſo extreamly diſturbed and changed in his countenance uttering ſo many grievous ſighs, and uſing ſuch paſſionate geſtures that the Lords were in much admiration of the cauſe thereof. He knit his Brows, and bit his Lips, appearing extre<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>mly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned. After long ſilence, the more to prepare their attentions he asks confuſedly, what puniſhment they deſerved who had compaſſed, imagined and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trived the deſtruction of him who was ſo near allied to the King and Protector of his Perſon and Kingdom. At this queſtion the Lords were all amazed and ſate looking upon each other without ſpeaking a word, at
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:57822:38"/>
ength the Lord Haſtings (by the inſtigation of the Duke of Buckingham) preſuming upon his intimacy with the Protector, replied, That whoever they were, they deſerved to be puniſhed as Traytors, to which the other Lords aſſented. Whereat the Protector riſing up, Why it is, ſays he, that old Sorcereſs my Brother Edward's Widow, and her Partner that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Whore Jane Shore, that have by Witchcraft and Inchantment, contrived to take away my life. And though by God's Mercy they have not been able to fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh their Villany, yet ſee the miſchief they have done me, for behold (and then he ſhewed his left Arm naked and withered) how they have cauſed this dear Limb of mine to wither and grow uſeleſs, and my whole body had been in the ſame miſerable plight if they had executed their Wills upon me. The Lords who knew the goodneſs and virtue of the Queen, and that his Arm had been always withered from his birth, found it a falſe pretence, but were ſo aſtoniſh'd at his confidence that they durſt not utter a word, till the Lord Haſtings (thinking to lay all the fault upon the Queen, and excuſe Jane Shore whom he had taken for his Miſtreſs and Bed-fellow ever ſince King Edward's death, and from whom he had riſen that Morning) ſubmiſſively anſwered, <hi>If the Queen have conſpired</hi>—which he had no ſooner ſaid, but the Protector looking fiercely upon him, What, ſays he in a great rage, doſt thou tell me of If's and And's, I tell thee they and none but they have done it, and thou art Confederate with them in their Villany. Who I, my Lord? quoth he; Yea thou Traytor, ſays the Protector, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with ſtriking a ſound blow with his hand upon the Table, Treaſon was cried in the next room, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately a great number of armed men came ruſhing in as if to guard the Protector, one of whom with a furious blow of a Pole-axe, wounded the Lord Stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley in the head, and had certainly kill'd him, but that with the ſtroke he ſunk under the Table. The reſt of the Council were ſeized, and ſecured in ſeveral
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:57822:38"/>
Rooms. The Lord Haſtings the Protector charged with High Treaſon, and wiſhed him to make haſte and Confeſs himſelf, ſwearing by St. Paul, (his uſual Dath) that he would neither eat nor drink till his Head were off: It ſignified nothing to ask a reaſon, for he knew the Protector would give none; ſo he was carried to the Green in the Tower before the Chappel, where his Head was laid upon a long peice of Timber, and there ſtruck off, and his Head and Body afterward buried in Windſor Chappel, near King Edward IV.</p>
            <p>In the Tragical end of this Lord, we may obſerve how inevitable the ſtrokes of deſtiny are, for the very Night before his Death the Lord Stanley ſent a ſecret Meſſage to him at Midnight, in all haſt to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form him of a Dream he had, in which he thought that a Boar with his Tuſks had ſo goared them by the Heads, that the Blood ran about their Ears, and becauſe the Protector gave the Boar for his Arms, or Cognizance, this Dream had made ſo dreadful an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion upon his mind, that he was fully reſolved not to ſtay any longer, and had his Horſe ready, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiring the Lord Haſtings to go along with him; and that they might Ride ſo faſt as to be out of danger be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Morning. But the Lord Haſtings returned this Anſwer by the Meſſenger; Ah good Lord! Doth thy Maſter inſiſt ſo much upon Trifles, and has he ſuch faith in Dreams, which either proceed from fancy, or from the thoughts of the preceeding Day; but if they foretel things to come, why may they not preſage; that if we run away and ſhould be taken, then the Boar might have ſome reaſon to uſe us ill; Therefore commend me to thy Maſter, and bid him <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

<pb n="72" facs="tcp:57822:39"/>
miſtaken, for after he became ſo great with the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tector, Cateſby was the firſt Man that adviſed the taking off the Lord Haſtings: Likewiſe the ſame Morning he was Beheaded, his Horſe ſtumbled twice or thrice almoſt to falling, which though it often hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen by chance, yet has been ſometimes reckoned a token of misfortune. Moreover, at the ſame time coming to Tower-Wharf, he there met a Purſivant of his own Name, which made him recal what had hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened to him ſome time before, in that place; for he was accuſed by the Lord Rivers in King Edward IV. Reign, of ſome Crimes which for a time caſt him out of the King's favour, and indangered his Life, but was after reſtored again into Grace.</p>
            <p>Now ſeeing this Man, Ah Haſtings quoth the Lord, Thou canſt not forget that the laſt time I met thee here it was with a heavy Heart: Yes my Lord, ſaid the Purfivant, I remember it very well, but thanks be to God your Enemies gained nothing, nor had your Lordſhip any damage thereby, and now the danger is over: Thou wouldeſt ſay ſo indeed, ſaid the Lord, if thou kneweſt as much as I do, for the World is well changed now, and my Enemies are in greater danger, as thou mayſt happen to hear in a few days: (the Enemies he meant, were the Lord Rivers and others of the Queens Kindre<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

By this we may learn that there is no greater ſign of ill fortune than to be too ſecure, and that Men are blind as to their own Fate, and though the Ax hangs over their Heads, yet are not ſenſible of it, but are oft moſt in danger when they think themſelves ſafe, and moſt ſafe when they judg themſelves in danger. For this Lord not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding his great confidence, loſt his Head two hours after he ſpoke theſe words.</p>
            <p>The ſame Morning, as the Lord Haſtings was going to the Council in tht Tower, a Knight who pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed

kindneſs to him, but was thought to be privy to the Protector's deſigns, and ſent to meet and haſten him thither, offered to accompany him. The Lord Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtings ſtaid by the way in Tower-ſtreet, to diſcourſe with a Prieſt whom he met; the Knight jokingly interrupted their talk, ſaying, Pray, my Lord, make haſte, for you have no need of a Prieſt yet, ſeeming to be in jeſt, but it was thought, meant in earneſt that he would in a ſhort time have occaſion for one.</p>
            <p>The news of the Death of the Lord Haſtings, ſoon flew into the City, and much ſurprized the People, but the Protector to prevent any Commotion, ſent for ſeveral of the Principal Citizens to come to him with all ſpeed. At their appearance, himſelf with the Duke of Buckingham, received them in Old Ruſty Armour, to make a ſhew as if the preſent danger had obliged them to take what they could firſt come by, and then the Protector declared to them; That the Lord Haſtings, and other Conſpirators, had contrived to have ſlain him and the Duke of Buckingham in Council, and then to have taken upon them to Govern the King and Kingdom at their pleaſure: Of which Treaſon they had made diſcovery, but few hours be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it ſhould have been acted; ſo that their ſudden fear had cauſed them to put on ſuch Armour as they firſt met with, but that God had ſo far prevented their Traiterous purpoſes, as ſome had already receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed their deſerts. This he required them to report to the People: The Citizens ſeemed as if they had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved what he ſaid, though they all knew nothing was more falſe. Preſently after a Proclamation was pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed throughout the City; reciting the aforenamed particulars, and adding ſeveral reflections upon the Lord Haſtings, as that he was an Evil Councellour to King Edward IV. Adviſing him to do many things to his great Diſhonour, and the damage of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom by his ill Example and Converſation, particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly in the lewdneſs of his Life, which he ſtill con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:57822:40"/>
with Shore's, Wife who was one of the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal Conſpirators, with whom he had converſt the very laſt night, and that it was no wonder if ſuch a wicked courſe of Life had brought him to ſuch an untimely Death, which he was condemned to ſuffer by the ſpecial command of the King and his Honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Privy Council, before whom he was clearly Convicted to have contrived this horrid Treaſon, and whoſe ſudden Execution according to his demerits, they hoped would prevent the other Conſpirators, from proceeding in their Traiterous purpoſes, and ſecure the Peace of the Nation.</p>
            <p>Now this Proclamation was publiſhed within two hours after the Lord Haſtings was Beheaded, and was ſo exactly perceived, and fairly Written in Parch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and withal ſo long, that all the World per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived it had been prepared long before, which oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſioned the School Maſter of St. Pauls at the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claiming it to ſay; <hi>Here is a gay goodly caſt, foul caſt away for haſte,</hi> To whom a Merchant Anſwered; <hi>That it was written by Propheſie, or Revelation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>After this the Protector, like an Innocent, conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent Prince, ſent the Sheriffs of London to Jane Shore's Houſe, (who lived from her Huſband) with an order to ſeize all her Goods, which they did to the value of two or 3000 Marks, and committed her to Priſon: He charging her with bewitch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him, and with conſpiring with the Lord Haſtings, to deſtroy him, but having no proof of any thing, be then gravely accuſed her of what all the Kingdom knew before, and ſhe her ſelf could not deny; that ſhe was Unchaſte of her Body, which made Men ſmile that it ſhould be now told as new: Hereupon he cauſed the Biſhop of London to put her to open Pennance for Incontinency, and the next Sunday ſhe was brought out of Ludgate, going before a Croſs in Proceſſion, with a Wax Taper in her hand, and though ſhe was then in mean Apparel, having only her Girdle on, yet ſhe appeared ſo fair and love<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:57822:40"/>
the crowd of Spectators raiſing a comely bluſh in her Cheeks, and withal ſo modeſt and ſober, that ſhe was much commended by them, who had more love for her Body than for her Soul; yea thoſe that ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted her vitious life, and were glad to ſee Sin puniſhed, yet pitied her miſery, and hard uſage from him, who inflicted it for wicked and politick ends, and not out of love to Virtue, or Chaſtity.</p>
            <p>This Woman was a notable inſtance of the mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tability of Fortune; ſhe was born in London, of a good Family, and very well Married to one Shore, a ſober worthy Citizen and Goldſmith, but it was thought, a little too Young; ſo that ſhe never ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed much affection to her Huſband, whom ſhe was <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

               </gap> imbrace King Edward's Kindneſs: Which being attended with Honour, Riches, Fine Cloaths, Eaſe, Pleaſure, and all other humane delights, was hardly to be reſiſted by ſuch a tender heart as ſhe had: When the King had taken her for his Miſtriſs, her Huſband wholly abandoned her Bed: After his Death the Lord Haſtings, who had an extream paſſion for her during the King's Life, but either out of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect, or faithfulneſs, forbore Courting her, now took her home to his Houſe, and maintained her in great ſplendor: She was very fair and proper, and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing amiſs in her whole Body, but that ſome thought her not tall enough, as ſome report who knew her in her Youth, (ſaith Sir Thomas More) but now ſhe is Old, ſaith he, who ſaw her, ſhe is lean, withered, and her Skin ſo extreamly ſhrivelled, that it is ſcarce to be imagined ſo much beauty and comelineſs ever re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſided in that wretched Carcaſs. Yet ſhe was not more admired for her handſomeneſs, then for her ready wit, and briſk temper; neither too full, nor too ſparing in diſcourſe, jeſting oft without abuſe, but very pleaſantly, ſo that her company was extream entertaining. King Edward uſed to ſay, That he had three Concubines, who were excellent for three dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:57822:41"/>
Qualities; One being the merrieſt, another the moſt politick and ſubtile, and the third the moſt devout Harlot in the World; who when he ſent for to his Bed, was uſually at Prayers upon her knees in the Church; the other two were Perſons of greater Quality, but Jane Shore was the merrieſt, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the King took much delight in her converſation; for though he had many Miſtreſſes, yet he may be ſaid only to love her, and to ſay the truth, ſhe never abuſed the kindneſs he had for her to the detriment or hurt of any, but to the relief of very many, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peaſing the King's anger toward ſome, getting abate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Fines, reſtoring others to favour, diſpatching their Suits and Affairs, and all for little or no reward. Valuing any thing that was fine or pretty above great Summs of Money, being contented either with the pleaſure of doing kindneſſes, or of being Courted and Petitioned for them, to ſhew what power ſhe had with the King; or laſtly, becauſe wanton Women are not always Covetous. It may be thought, ſays Sir Thomas More, That this Woman is too ſlight a Subject among matters of a greater conſequence, but ſays he, She to me ſeems worthy of Remark, that ſhe ſhould now be a miſerable beggar, without Friends, or Money, but what ſhe gets by Charity, who was formerly in ſuch great favour with a renowned Prince, was adored by the Courtiers, addreſſed unto by Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of the higheſt Quality, for expediting their buſineſs, as much as the greateſt Favourites of this Age: Had abundance of Riches, and all other goods of fortune: And yet ſhould become ſo wretched a Creature as ſhe is at this day, being obliged to beg of thoſe now living, that muſt have begged them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, if it had not been for her kindneſs toward them.</p>
            <p>To proceed: It was contrived by the Protector, the Duke of Buckingham, and the the other bloody Councellours, that the very day the Lord Haſtings was Beheaded in the Tower, and at the very ſame
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:57822:41"/>
hour, he himſelf conſenting to it, the Lord Rivers, and the other Lords and Knights that were taken from the King at Northampton, were Beheaded at Pomfret, which was done in the preſence, and by the order of Sir Richard Ratcliff, whoſe ſervice the Protector much uſed in theſe affairs, he being a Man of a ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licious wit, and cruel nature, and fit for any miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chievous deſigns. Who bringing them out of Priſon to the Scaffold, and telling the People they were Traytors, not ſuffering them to declare their Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence, leſt their words ſhould have inclined the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to pity them and hate the Protector, he cauſed them haſtily, without Tryal, Witneſſes, Sentence, or any Legal Proceſs, to be Beheaded, only becauſe they were Loyal to the King, and too near a Kin to the Queen his Mother.</p>
            <p>Theſe Noblemen being thus diſpatched, the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tector now reſolved to advance himſelf to the Crown, whileſt the Peers and People being amazed, and ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified at theſe proceedings durſt not interpoſe to hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der him: But becauſe the matter would ſeem ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding odious, he and his wicked Council conſulted how to put a fair gloſs thereupon. Several ways were propoſed, among the reſt they thought it neceſſary to bring in Edward Shaw then Lord Mayor of London, who upon promiſe of advancement, ſhould prepare the Peoples Inclinations; and becauſe Clergy-men are hearkned to in Matters of Conſcience, therefore Doctor Shaw the Lord Mayor's Brother, and Doctor Pinke, Provincial of the Auguſtine Friers, are like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe ingaged in the Affair, both great Preachers, but of more Learning than Virtue, and of more fame than Learning, having a notable eſtimation among the Vulgar. Theſe two were appointed to Preach, the one at Paul's-Croſs, and the other at the Spittle, and to diſplay the excellent Qualities of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tector: Pinke in his Sermon ſo loſt his Voice that he was forced to break off, and come down in the midſt; and Doctor Shaw by his Sermon loſt his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation,
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:57822:42"/>
and ſoon after his Life, for he was ſo a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhamed of it, that he never after came abroad.</p>
            <p>But the next perplexity was to get ſome plauſible pretence for depoſing the Young King, and advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing his Uncle: After ſeveral alterations, they at length concluded to alledge Baſtardy, either in King Edward IV. himſelf, or in his Children, or both; to lay Baſtardy publickly to King Edward, would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flect upon the reputation of the Mother both of his Brother and himſelf. The Protector therefore or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered that point to be handled tenderly, but the Baſtardy of the Children he would have openly and boldly aſſerted, and to ground their Allegations upon the following pretext.</p>
            <p>After King Edward IV. had depoſed King Henry VI. and got Poſſeſſion of the Throne, he determined to Marry, and thereupon Richard Nevil, the Great Earl of Warwick is ſent to France to Treat of a Marriage between the King and the Lady Bona, Daughter to Lewis Duke of Savoy, and Siſter to the Lady Carlote then Queen of France. The propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition is readily imbraced in France, the Match ſoon concluded: In the mean time King Edward being Hunting in Wichwood Forreſt near Stony Stratford, happened to come to the Manour of Graſton, where the Dutcheſs of Bedford then lay, and where her Daughter by Sir Richard Woodvile, called the Lady Elizabeth Gray (Widow of Sir John Gray of Gro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by, Slain in the Battel of St. Albans,) came to Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rition the King for ſome Lands, of which her Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band had made her a Jointure: With whoſe beauty and graceful mein the King was ſo ſurprized, that he preſently fell to Courting her. The Lady perceiving his intent, told him plainly, That as ſhe thought her ſelf not worthy to be his Wife, ſo ſhe eſteemed her ſelf too good to be his Concubine. The King who very ſeldom was denied ſuch favours, his handſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and dignity making him acceptable to moſt Ladies, ſo much admired her Virtue that he reſolved
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:57822:42"/>
to Marry her. His Mother having notice of it en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured to prevent the Match, telling him, That it would be both honourable and ſafe to Marry ſome Great Princeſs, and thereby ſtrengthen his Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment by Potent Alliances. That it was below him to Marry his own Subject, and eſpecially a Widow, that had Children, he being a Young Man and a Batchellor. Laſtly, that he was already Contracted to the Lady Elizabeth Lucy. The King Anſwered, That as to Honour and Alliances, they might bring more trouble than profit; and whereas you object Madam, (ſays he) That the Lady is a Widow and has Children, By God's Bleſſed Lady, I am a Batch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ellor, and have ſome Children too, and ſo we have both proof that we are not like to be Barren, and for your alledging that I am already Contracted to the Lady Elizabeth Lucy: Let the Biſhop, ſaith he, charge me with it when I come to take Orders, for I underſtand, it is forbidden to a Prieſt, but I never heard before that it was prohibited to a Prince; and ſoon after he Married the Lady Elizabeth Grey.</p>
            <p>Upon this Pretext the Protector would found the Baſtardy of King Edward's Children. That he had been formerly Contracted to the Lady Elizabeth Lucy, though the Lady her ſelf upon Examination, acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged ſhe had a Child by him, but denied there was any Contract between them. However upon this ground Doctor Shaw took for his Text, <hi>Baſt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1+ letters">

<pb n="80" facs="tcp:57822:43"/>
and Countenance, as well as the Courage, and Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanimity of the Renowned Richard Duke of York, his Father.</p>
            <p>Now it was contrived, That at the uttering theſe words the Protector ſhould have come in and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared to the People, that the Preacher's words, and his preſence thus correſponding, it might be thought he had ſpoke them by the ſpecial Inſpiration of the Holy Ghoſt. But this trick failed, for either by the Protector's delay in coming, or the Doctor's haſte in Preaching, he had proceeded for ſome time upon o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther matters: At length obſerving the Protector was coming, he without order or reaſon, diverted from the matter he was upon, and began to repeat the ſame words again. <hi>This is that Noble Prince, the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's own Picture, his own Face, and the expreſs Image of his Father's Perſon.</hi> In the mean time the Protector with the Duke of Buckingham, preſſed through the crowd to the Pulpit, and there ſate to hear the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon. But the People were ſo far from crying out, <hi>God ſave King</hi> Richard, as was expected, That they cried ſhame on the Preacher, for abuſing his Calling to ſuch vile purpoſes.</p>
            <p>The Tueſday following the Duke of Buckingham with divers Lords and Knights came to Guildhall Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, and the Lord Mayor, Aldermen and Commons being their aſſembled, the Duke of Buckingham made a long Speech to them to this effect. <q rend="margSglQuotes">'That the Lord Protector and the reſt of the noble Peers were come to acquaint the worthy Citizens with a matter of great conſequence, and which they did not doubt would be very pleaſing and acceptable to them.

            <p>Having ended his long Oration, the People ſtood mute, as admiring at the motion, but none cried King Richard, King Richard, as was expected. At which the Duke being amazed, ſuppoſing the Lord Mayor had before informed and prepared the Common Hall, he whiſpered to him to know the meaning of this ſul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len ſilence. The Lord Mayor anſwered, It may be
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:57822:44"/>
they did not hear, or at leaſt underſtand what he had ſaid. Hereupon the Duke repeated the ſame words, more audibly and earneſtly, but this obſtinate ſilence ſtill continued. Then the Duke deſired that the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corder, who uſually ſpoke to the People, might move them in it. But the Recorder, named Fitz Williams, being an honeſt man, and newly come to his Office, repeated the Duke's words only, without adding any of his own. So that this nothing prevailed upon their reſolved ſullenneſs. At laſt the Duke told them plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, That all the Nobility and Commons of the Realm were determined to chuſe the Protector for their King, as the true and undoubted Heir, and that it was only out of reſpect and kindneſs to the Citizens that they had acquainted them with it, deſiring them freely to ſpeak whether they would join with them in this Election or No. Upon this ſome of the Duke's Servants, and others planted on purpoſe at the lower end of the Hall threw up their Caps and ſhouted aloud, King Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chard, King Richard, while the Citizens ſtood mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muring and inquiring among themſelves what the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of it was.</p>
            <p>However the Duke took the advantage of it, as of an unanimous conſent, A goodly cry, quoth he: Giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them all thanks for their univerſal approbation, promiſing he would acquaint the Protector with their great kindneſs toward him, requiring the Lord Mayor, and Citizens to meet the Protector the next Morning at Baynard's Caſtle. Being met accordingly, the Duke of Buckingham ſends up word to the Lord Protector, that the Lord Mayor and his Bretheren were come to preſent a ſupplication to him, in a matter of great conſequence. The Protector though pre-acquainted with the matter, yet pretended to admire what the buſineſs ſhould be, and though he did ſuſpect no ill from any thing which the Duke of Buckingham ſhould offer, yet deſired ſome hint of what it might be. It was Anſwered, That the buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs was to be communicated only to himſelf in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:57822:44"/>
and therefore they humbly deſired to be admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted into his preſence: Hereupon as if not well aſſured of their intent, he appears to them in the Gallery, to prevent any ſiniſter practice againſt him. The Duke of Buckingham with great reverence tells him, That he hoped his Highneſs would pardon him in what he was going to declare in the behalf of the Lord Mayor and Nobility there preſent, and after many circumſtances, proceeds to diſcover the cauſe of their coming, That in regard of the urgent neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of the Common-wealth, they all humbly intrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted him to take upon him the Government of the Kingdom in his own Right, to whom they all ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered their Alleglance: At which word the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tector ſtarted back as if extreamly ſurprized, and paſſionately replied. <q rend="margSglQuotes">'I little thought good Couſin, that you of all Men would have moved me in a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, which of all things in the World I muſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline!

He replied: <q rend="margSglQuotes">'Since I perceive the whole Kingdom are reſolved by no means to admit my dear Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phews, being but Children, to Reign over them, and ſince the Right of Succeſſion juſtly belongs to me as the undoubted Heir of Richard Plantaginet, Duke of York, my Renowned Father: We are contented to condeſcend to your Importunities, and to accept the Regal Government of the Kingdom; and will to the utmoſt of my power endeavour to procure and maintain the quiet and welfare thereof.</q>
            </p>
            <p>After this he came down from his Gallery, and very formally Saluted them all, which ſo pleaſed the giddy and inconſtant Mobile, that they preſently ſhouted out, Long live King Richard our Dread So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraign Lord, and ſo every Man departed.</p>
            <p>Having thus Uſurped the Soveraignty, He was ſoon after Crowned: Creating his Son Edward a Child of Ten years old, Prince of Wales; advancing ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral of the Nobility to higher Honours, and Digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying others.

            <p>And now King Richard with his Queen (the Lady Ann, Youngeſt Daughter of the Great Earl of War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wick, and the Widow of Prince Edward Son to King Henry VI.) whom he had newly Married, made a progreſs to Gloceſter, upon pretence of viſiting the place of his former Honour: But in truth to be ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent while he had a ſpecial villany to be acted. For though he had ſatisfied his Ambition by depriving his Nephews of their Livelyhood; yet he could not remove his fears without taking away their Lives: To perpetrate this villany he durſt not uſe the aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of his old Friend and Favourite the Duke of

Buckingham, as being ſenſible of his abhorrence thereof. However it was too eaſie to find wicked In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments for Money, and upon inquiry, he heard of two Brothers in his Court, Sir Thomas, and Sir James Tyrril, the firſt of an honeſt ſober temper, but the other of a proud ambitious humour, and ready to commit any wickedneſs for preferment. Being told of this Man as he was at the Cloſe-Stool, he inſtantly roſe and went to him, whom he found more free to undertake the work than he was to imploy him, ſo the bargain was ſoon made, and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing remained but an opportunity to effect it.</p>
            <p>King Richard had before ſent John Green one of his Privadoes, to Sir Robert Brackenbury, Lieutenant of the Tower, to require him to do the deed, he being raiſed by him, but the Lieutenant declaring an abſolute averſion thereto; Good Lord, ſays the King, <hi>Whom can a Man truſt:</hi> So that finding he muſt be removed, or elſe it was impoſſible to effect it, he ſends him an abſolute Order by Sir James Tyrril, immediately to deliver up the Keys of the Tower to him. Tyrril being now Lieutenant for the time, hires two Raſcals like himſelf, Giles Foreſt, and James Leighton his Hoſtler, a ſtout luſty fellow, to join with him in the Murder of theſe Innocent Children, who coming into their Chamber in the Night, accompanied only with one Black Will, or William Slaughter another bloody Villain, they ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly wrapt them up in the Bed-cloaths, and keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing down the Pillow and Bed-cloaths, with all their ſtrength upon their Mouths, they ſo ſtifled them that their breath failing, they ſurrendred up their Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent Souls to Heaven. The Murtherers perceiving, Firſt by their ſtrugling with the pangs of Death, and then by their long lying ſtill, that they were tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roughly Dead, they laid their Bodies out upon the Bed, and then called Sir James to ſee them, who preſently cauſed their Bodies to be buried under the Stairs, under a heap of Stones, from whence they
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:57822:46"/>
were afterward removed to a place of Chriſtian Burial, by a Prieſt of Sir Robert Brackenbury, who dying ſoon after it, was never known where they were laid; which gave occaſion to the Impoſture in K. Henry VII. Reign of Perkin Warbeck, who pretended to be Richard Duke of York the Younger Brother, that by the compaſſion of the Murtherers was ſaved, and ſent to ſeek his Fortune. Others write that King Richard cauſed their Bodies to be taken up, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing cloſed in Lead, to be put into a Coffin full of holes, hooked at the ends with Iron, and ſo thrown into a place called the Black Deep, at the Thames mouth, to ſecure them from being ever ſeen or riſing again.</p>
            <p>But Divine Vengeance ſoon reached the Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therers, Miles Forreſt rotting away alive peice meal at St. Martins Le Grand: Leighton dyed at Callice, deteſted of all Men, and in great miſery; Sir James Tyrril was afterward Beheaded for Treaſon at Tower-Hill, and King Richard himſelf after this execrable Fact, never was quiet in mind, being tormented with fearful Dreams, ſtarting out of his Bed, and running about the Chamber with great horror, as if all the Fiends in Hell had been about him to torture his vexed Soul.</p>
            <p>And here we may obſerve, That Confederacies in Evil ſeldom continue long, but uſually end in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciprocal ruin: And thus it happened with King Richard, and the Duke of Buckingham his intimate Favourite, who had been Confederates in the Death of many; which now diſſolves in the deſtruction of them both. What the cauſe of the firſt breach was could not be known: Whether the Duke did not think he was ſufficiently rewarded for his Services: Or that King Richard did not judg himſelf ſafe, whileſt he that ſet him on the Throne remained ſo Great: Or that the Duke being Ambitious and Aſpiring, grew envious at his own aſt in advancing him. The laſt of which conjectures he ſeemed to
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:57822:46"/>
confirm by pretending ſickneſs to avoid being preſent at the Coronation: Which King Richard was jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous of, and therefore obliged him to come by ſend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing word, That if he did not, he would ferch him. Whereupon the Duke came with ſo ill a will that ever after there was no good underſtanding between them, retiring preſently after to his Caſtle at Breck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nock.</p>
            <p>And here the inſcrutable depth of Divine Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence is very remarkable, which the greateſt Polititians cannot Fathom. For the King had com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted the Biſhop of Ely to the Duke's cuſtody, as one that would ſecure him from doing any hurt, and therefore deſigned it for the Biſhop's puniſhment. Whereas this very thing occaſioned the Biſhop's liberty and advancement, and was a means of King Richard's deſtruction. For the Duke retiring home, ſeemed to be much diſturbed and diſcontented in his mind, and wanting reſt, would be ſometimes talking with the Biſhop, who being a Man of great Wit and Judgment, the Duke became at length extreamly pleaſed with his company, and opened himſelf more freely to him, whereby the Biſhop perceived that the chief cauſe of his trouble was his envy to King Richard; and thereupon he took an opportunity to diſcourſe him to this purpoſe.</p>
            <p>My Lord, <q rend="margSglQuotes">'You know that formerly I took part with King Henry VI. and could have wiſhed his Son had enjoyed the Crown, but after God had ordain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed King Edward IV. to Reign, I was never ſo mad to contend for a dead Prince againſt a living one; and ſo I was a faithful Chaplain to King Edward, and would have been glad his Child had ſucceeded him, but ſince by the ſecret judgment of God it hath happened otherwiſe, I will not ſtrive to ſet up that which God hath pluck'd down: And as for the Lord Protector and now King —</q>
            </p>
            <p>Here the Biſhop made a ſudden pauſe, ſaying, He had already medled too much in the World, and
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:57822:47"/>
would for the future be concerned with nothing but his Books and his Beads. Becauſe he ended with King, the Duke was impatient to have him proceed, ſaithfully promiſing no hurt ſhould come from it, but it may be much good; aſſuring him that the reaſon why he deſired the King to put him under his cuſtody, was that he might ſecretly aſk his councel and adviſe. My Lord, Said the Biſhop, I humbly thank your Grace, but I confeſs I do not much care to talk of Princes, ſince it may often prove dangerous, though nothing be ill meant: But a Man's words may be interpreted, not as he intended them, but as the Prince pleaſes to conſtrue them, which puts me in mind of one of Aeſop's Fables. The Lyon had publiſhed a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamation, That upon pain of death no Horned Beaſt ſhould continue in an adjoining Wood, now a certain Beaſt that had a bunch in his forehead, flying away in great haſte was met by a Fox, who aſk'd him whither he ran ſo faſt? Faſt, quoth he, I think it is time to run if I intend to ſave my life? Why Brother Reynard, han't you heard of the Proclamation againſt Horned Beaſts? What then you Fool, quoth the Fox, That does not concern you, for I am ſure you have no Horns on your Head: Ay marry, quoth the Beaſt, that I know well enough, but what if the Lyon ſhould call my bunch a horn, where were I then, Brother Reynard? The Duke laughed at the ſtory, and ſaid, My Lord, I warrant you neither the Lyon nor the Boar ſhall pick any matter out of any thing that has been ſpoken, for it ſhall never come near their Ears. In good faith, Sir, ſays the Biſhop, What we have ſaid if taken as we meant it, could only deſerve thanks, but being wreſted as ſome would do, might be of ill conſequence to us both. The Duke intreated him to go on, in his former diſcourſe; My Lord, ſaid the Biſhop, As for the late Protector, ſince he is now King in poſſeſſion, I ſhall not diſpute his Title, but for the good of the Kingdom, I could wiſh he had in him thoſe excellent Virtues where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:57822:47"/>
God Almighty has qualified your Grace. Here he ſtopt again; My Lord ſaid the Duke, I much won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der at theſe ſudden pauſes, which ſo interrupt your diſcourſe, that I can neither comprehend your thoughts of the King, nor your affection to my ſelf, I there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore beg of you not to conceal your thoughts any longer, but freely to diſcover your ſentiments; and upon my Honour, I will be as ſecret as the Deaf and Dumb perſon is to the Singer, or the Tree to the Hunter. The Biſhop upon the aſſurance of the Dukes, thus followed his diſcourſe.</p>
            <p>My Lord, <q rend="margSglQuotes">'I plainly perceive that this Realm is in great danger of being brought to confuſion and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolation under the preſent Government; but I have ſtill ſome hope remaining, by the dayly obſervation of your Noble Perſonage, your Juſtice, your ardent love to your Countrey, and likewiſe the great love the People have toward you, and ſhould think the Kingdom fortunate which had a Prince ſo fit and apt to be their Governour as your ſelf, whoſe Perſon and actions contain in them all that is truly great, juſt and honourable.</q> He then reproached the King for his many Murders, Cruelties, and Oppreſſions, adding, <q rend="margSglQuotes">'And now my Lord, If you love God, your poſterity, or your Native Country, you muſt your ſelf take upon you the Imperial Crown and Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dem of this Realm: But if you refuſe the ſame, I then adjure you by the Faith you owe to God, and the regard you ought to have for your Native Land, in your Princely Wiſdom, to contrive ſome means whereby the Kingdom may be ſetled in Peace, Liberty and ſafety under a Legal Government; and if you think fit to advance again the Houſe of Lancaſter, or to Marry the Eldeſt Daughter of King Edward IV. to ſome powerful Prince; the new Crowned King may be quickly removed from his Uſurp'd Throne, and thereby Peace and Plenty, and Tranquility will again be reſtored to the Nation.</q>

            <p>The Biſhop having ended his Speech, the Duke remained ſilent for ſome time, only breathing forth many deep ſighs, which much ſtartled the Biſhop, and made his colour change. The Duke perceiving it, Be not afraid my Lord, ſaid he, All promiſes ſhall be kept; and ſo for that time they parted. Next day the Duke ſent for the Biſhop, and having repeat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed their former diſcourſe, he proceeded; <q rend="margSglQuotes">'My Lord of Ely, Becauſe I diſcern you have a real kindneſs and affection for me, I will freely unboſom my Thoughts to you: After I obſerved the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſimulation and falſhood of King Richard, and eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially when I heard of the Barbarous Murther of the two Young Princes, to which, God is my wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, I never condeſcended, I ſo much abhorr'd his preſence, and company, that I left the Court upon a pretended excuſe, he not in the leaſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving my diſcontent, and ſo returned to Brecknock to you. In my return, whether by Inſpiration, or Melancholy, I was poſſeſt with many Imaginations and Contrivances, how to deprive this Unnatural and Bloody Butcher, of his Royal Seat and Dignity. Firſt, I fancied that if I had a mind to take the Crown, now was the time, the Tyrant being ſo generally abhorred and deteſted of all Men, and believing that I had the neareſt right to the Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion. In this imagination I continued two days at Tewkſbury, and was ruminating whether I was beſt to take upon me the Crown as Conqueror, but I preſently thought that then certainly both the Nobility and Commons would uſe their utmoſt Efforts againſt me. But at length I happened on ſomething that I did not doubt would have brought forth fair Flowers; yet proved at length nothing but Weeds. For I was thinking that Edmund Duke of Somerſet my Grandfather, was with Henry VI. within two or three degrees of John of Gaunt, Duke of Lancaſter; and my Mother being Eldeſt Daughter to Duke Edmund, I ſuppoſed my ſelf to
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:57822:48"/>
be next Heir to King Henry VI. of the Houſe of Lancaſter. This Title was well pleaſing to thoſe whom I made of my Council, but much more to my aſpiring mind, but while I was perplext whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it were beſt inſtantly to publiſh this my Right, or wait ſome better opportunity, obſerve what happened: As I rid from Worceſter to Bridg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>north, I met the Lady Margaret, Counteſs of Rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond, now Wife to the Lord Stanley, and Daughter and Sole Heir to John Duke of Somerſet, my Grand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>father's Elder Brother, whom I had as utterly for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>got, as if I had never known her, ſo that ſhe and her Son Henry Earl of Richmond, have a Right before me. By this I perceived my miſtake, and reſolved to relinquiſh all Ambitious Thoughts, and to endeavour the Eſtabliſhment of the Earl of Rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond, Right Heir of the Houſe of Lancaſter; and that he ſhould Marry the Lady Elizabeth, Eldeſt Daughter to King Edward, ſo that the two Roſes might be hereby united. And now ſaid the Duke, I have told you my whole Heart.</q>
            </p>
            <p>The Biſhop was very glad that they had both hit upon the ſame deſign, and extolling his well laid contrivance, replied, Since by your Graces incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parable prudence this Noble Conjunction is intended, it will be neceſſary to conſider who are fitteſt to be acquainted with it. By my troth quoth the Duke, we will begin with the Counteſs of Richmond the Earl's Mother, who will inform us whether he be under Confinement, or at Liberty in Brittain. And thus was the Foundation of a League laid by theſe two Great Men, which fully Revenged the Death of the two Innocent Princes: And it was proſecuted with all Expedition; one Reynold Bray being imployed by the Biſhop, to his Lady the Counteſs of Rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond; Doctor Lewis the Dutcheſſes Phyſician, was ſent to Queen Elizabeth, and two other Perſons were ordered privately to wait upon the Earl of Rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond then in France, and acquaint him with the
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:57822:49"/>
Deſign, and procure his conſent to the intended Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage. Who coming to the Earl, and giving him information of the Plot; He thereupon diſcovers it to the Duke of Brittain, who though by Hutton King Rich. Ambaſſador, he had by many great offers been ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licited to detain the Earl in Priſon, yet he readily promiſed, and really offered him his utmoſt aſſiſtance: Several Knights and Gentlemen were alſo brought into the Confederacy in England. Biſhop Morton, though againſt the Earl's conſent, retires in diſguiſe into the Iſle of Ely, where having prepared his Friends to eſpouſe the Earl's Intereſt, he went from thence to Brittain to him, and continued there, till the Earl, when King, ſent for him home, and made him Archbiſhop of Canterbury.</p>
            <p>But though all was managed with the utmoſt Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vacy, and under Oaths of Secreſie; yet King Richard had made a diſcovery thereof; but pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Ignorance he ſends for the Duke of Buckingham to come to him: Which the Duke endeavouring to avoid by pretended excuſes, He at laſt peremptorily commands him to appear upon his Allegiance; upon which the Duke returned this reſolute Anſwer, <q rend="margSglQuotes">'That ne owed no Allegiance to ſuch a perjured, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>humane Butcher of his own Fleſh and Blood.</q> And ſo from that time preparations of War are made on each ſide. The Duke had Aſſembled a good num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of Welſhman, and the Marqueſs of Dorſet, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving got out of Sanctuary, was labouring to raiſe Forces in Yorkſhire. The two Courtneys were doing the ſame in Devonſhire and Cornwall, and the Lords Guilford and Rame in Kent: King Richard ſets for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward with his Forces; The Duke of Buckingham Marches to incounter him, intending at Gloceſter to have paſt the Severn, and joined the two Courtneys, but the great Rains had ſo ſwelled the River, that overflowing its Banks there was no Fording over. This Inundation was ſo great, that Men were drown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in their Beds, Houſes overturned, Children car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:57822:49"/>
about the Fields, Swiming in Cradles, and Beaſts were drowned on Hills, which rage of Water continued Ten days, and is to this time in the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treys adjacent, called, The Great Water, or the Duke of Buckingham's Water. The Welſhmen were ſo affrighted with this accident, that judging it an ill Omen, they all ſecretly deſerted him, ſo that the Duke being alone without either Page or Footman, retired to the Houſe of one Humfrey Baniſter, near Shrewsbury, who having been advanced by him and his Father, he thought himſelf ſafe under his roof. But Baniſter upon King Richard's Proclamation of a reward of 1000. Pound to him that ſhould diſcover the Duke, Treacherouſly and perfidiouſly diſcovered him to John Mitton High Sheriff of Shropſhire, who took him in a Thread-bare Black Cloak, walking in an Orchard behind the Houſe, and carried him to Shrewſbury where King Richard quartered, and there without Arraignment, or Legal Proceeding he was in the Market place Beheaded in 1484. Whether Baniſter received the proclaimed reward from King Richard's hand is uncertain; but it is certain he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived a reward of a Villain, from the hand of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Juſtice; for himſelf was after hanged for Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhughter, his Eldeſt Daughter was Raviſhed by one of his Plowmen, or as ſome ſay ſtruck with a loath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome Leproſie, his Eldeſt Son in a deſperate Lunacy Murdered himſelf, and his Younger Son was drowned in a ſmall puddle of Water.</p>
            <p>This was the fatal end of the Great Duke of Buck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingham, who went too far for a good Man, in being acceſſary to the depriving the Innocent Princes of their Birth-right, and declaring them Baſtards. But it ſeems he went not far enough for ſo bad a Man as King Richard, becauſe he would not conſent to the Murther of them. However, he fell by the ſame hand that advanced him to be his chief Favourite and Privado. And though King Richard now Triumph'd over his Enemies, yet in a very ſhort time, he loſt
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:57822:50"/>
both his Crown and Life in one day; the foundation of his Ruin having been firſt laid by this unproſper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Conſpiracy againſt him. For a while after he was Slain in a Battle at Boſworth, in Leiceſter ſhire, by Henry Earl of Richmond, who ſucceeded him by the name of King Henry the Seventh.</p>

left his Fellowſhip, and came to reſide in his Living: Where he had not been long when one Sir James Pawlet, upon ſome diſpleaſure ſet him in the Stocks; which affront was not forgotten nor for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>given by Woolſey: Who when by the mighty favour of Fortune he came to be Lord Chancellour of England; he ſent for Sir James, and after having ſharply reproved him, enjoined him not to ſtir out of the Middle-Temple, without Special Licenſe from himſelf, which he could not obtain in Six Year time.</p>
            <p>After the Death of the Marqueſs of Dorſet, from whom he expected higher preferment, his towring thoughts, aimed at ſome greater imployment, and ſince he found he muſt now make his own Fortune, he reſolved to take all opportunities to advance him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf. To this end he became acquainted with one Sir John Naphant, an Ancient Noble Knight, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly Treaſurer of Callice, under King Henry VII. to whom he was Chaplain, and by his Wiſdom and Diſcretion, gained ſuch favour with his Maſter, that he committed all the care and charge of his Office to his Chaplain.

The King inſtantly ſent for him, and diſcourſing with him about Matters of State, he found him endued with ſo much Eloquence, Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, Judgment, and Modeſty, that he cauſed his Commiſſion, and Inſtructions to be drawn up with all ſpeed: Which having received, he took his leave of the King at Richmond, at Four a Clock in the Afternoon, and in Three Hours arrived at Graveſend, from thence he Rid Poſt to Dover, and going a board the Paſſage-boat, he arrived next Day before Noon at Callice, and the ſame Night he made ſuch haſte that he came to the Emperour's Court, at Bruſſels in Flanders. Who having notice of this arrival, of the King of England's Ambaſſadour; out of great Affection to his Maſter, gave him Audience the ſame Evening. The Ambaſſadour having de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered his Meſſage and Credentials, and humbly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiring his ſpeedy diſmiſſion, the Emperour readily granted all his Maſter's Requeſts; and fully diſpatch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him the next Day. Hereupon he Rides back that Night Poſt to Callice, being attended by ſeveral Noblemen, by the Emperour's Order; and came thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in the Morning before the Gates were opened, and the Pacquet Boat being ready to go off, he ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived at Dover by Eleven at Noon, and the ſame Night came Poſt to Richmond, and the next Morning preſented himſelf to the King at his coming out of his Bed Chamber to Maſs, who checked him for not being upon his Journey. May it pleaſe your Highneſs ſaid he, I have been with the Emperour already, and I hope have diſpatched my Embaſſy to your Graces Satisfaction. The King admired at his Expedition, Aſking him whether he met with the Meſſenger ſent after him, before he thought him gone from London, with further Inſtructions of weighty Conſequence: Yes ſaid Woolſey, I met with him
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:57822:51"/>
Yeſterday by the way, and though I did know his Meſſage, yet preſuming upon your Highneſs goodneſs, and judging thoſe Matters very neceſſary to be done, I made bold to exceed my Commiſſion, and diſpatch them, for which I humbly beg your Majeſties Pardon. The King much pleaſed herewith, replied, We not only pardon you, but give you alſo our Royal Thanks, both for your diſcreet management and great Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition.</p>
            <p>Soon after the King beſtowed on him the Deanery of Lincoln, being one of the greateſt Promotions under the degree of a Biſhop; and in a ſhort time made him his Lord Almoner, wherein he behaved himſelf with ſo much diſcretion, that he was advanced to be one of the Lords of the Privy Council; and King Henry beſtowed on him Bridewell in Fleetſtreet, one of his Royal Houſes for his Reſidence and Family, and he was obſerved by the People to be a Riſing Favourite. For the King was Young, and much given to pleaſure; and his Ancient Councellours ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſing to be ſometimes preſent in Council, to conſult about the weighty Affairs of the Government; his Lord Almoner on the contrary, diſſuaded him from imbaraſing himſelf in the Troubles and Intreagues of State, aſſuring him, that if he would allow him ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Authority, he would eaſe him of thoſe Fatigues, and manage all Affairs to his content. This Advice was quickly received by the Youthful Prince, who gave him what Power he demanded, ſo that govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all things according to his own mind, he ſeemed to Rule more than the King himſelf.</p>
            <p>In the firſt Year of King Henry's Reign, a difference happened between him and the French King Lewis XII. who upon ſome private quarrel with Pope Julius II.

finding the Pope was unable to defend himſelf, offered to be a Mediatour of Peace between them. But the French King, fluſhed with Succeſs, refuſed or neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected his Propoſal, which ſo inflamed the vigorous mind of the Young King, that he declared to the World, As he ſcorned to be neglected, ſo he ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horred to be idle in this affair, and therefore reſolved by Invading the Dominions of France, to withdraw that King out of the Pope's Territories. In purſuance of this couragious reſolution, he inſtantly ſends Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadors to King Lewis, requiring him to deliver up to him the peaceable poſſeſſion of his two Dutchies of Guien and Normandy, together with his Ancient Inheritance of Anjon and Mayn, which had for many Years been wrongfully detained from his Predeceſſors and himſelf.</p>
            <p>The little acquaintance that the French King had with Henry, and the contempt of his Youth cauſed him to return a ſlighting denial of this his demand; whereupon King Henry proclaimed War againſt him, and reſolved to Invade his Countrey in Perſon, with a gallant Army, and believing no Man more proper to make proviſion for this great Expedition than his Almoner Woolſey: The King committed the ſole management thereof to his Wiſdom and Policy, and he ſcrupling no command of the King's, undertook this difficult charge; and proceeded therein ſo dex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terouſly, that all things were in a very ſhort time provided neceſſary for this noble Voyage. Upon which the King Marched with his Army to Dover, and Tranſporting them to Callice, he proceeded in order of Battle, to the ſtrong Town of Tymyn, which he vigorouſly aſſaulted and took. In which Siege the Emperor Maximillan, with Thirty Noblemen repair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to his Camp, and were all inrolled in the King's Pay. The King Marched from thence to Tournay, which he likewiſe attack'd with ſuch briſkneſs, that it was ſoon ſurrendred to him; which Biſhoprick the King beſtowed upon his Almoner Woolſey, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compence
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:57822:52"/>
for his care and diligence in this Expediti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. And then the King returned into England, where he was welcomed with the News of a great Victory, obtained by the Earl of Surrey, againſt James King of Scotland, he himſelf being Slain, with divers of his Nobility; and 18000 Scots and French, who came to his aſſiſtance.</p>
            <p>After the King's return the Biſhoprick of Lincoln becoming void, he beſtowed the ſame upon his Lord Almoner, and then the Archbiſhoprick of York, which was likewiſe vacant. Laſtly, he obtained of the Pope to be made a Cardinal, and his Maſter Henry, for his great Zeal to the Holy Chair, had the new Title of Defender of the Faith, confer'd upon him. Being ſuddenly mounted to ſuch a mighty height, and the King's affection daily increaſing, it made him ſo extream proud and inſolent, that he thought none to be his equal; and erected Eccleſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſtical Courts, and had the boldneſs to ſummon the Archbiſhop of Canterbury, and all other Biſhops and Clergymen to appear before him. And as his Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority was ſuperiour to all, ſo he exceeded them all in Covetouſneſs and Ambition; ſo that for many Years the Kingdom groaned under his monſtrous Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions, and violent Depredations. Yet his Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition was ſo exceſſive, that he ſtill hunted after greater Dominion; intermedling with affairs wherein he was not concerned, eſpecially in the Chancellor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, which then pertained to the Archbiſhop of Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terbury, who being Old, and perceiving how great a Favourite Woolſey was with the King, he choſe rather to deliver up the Seals than have them taken from him. Upon this ſurrender the King delivered them to Woolſey; which Favours and Dignities might have ſatisfied any, but the inſatiable mind of this Mighty Prelate, who was now Cardinal, Archbiſhop, Lord Chancellor, and Councellor of State.</p>
            <p>But he ſtill aimed to be Higher, and to gratifie his humour this occaſion offered: In 1517. Pope Leo

ſent Cardinal Campeius, as his Legate to King Henry, to Solicite him (as he had done the Kings of France, and Spain, and the Princes of Germany) to join in a League againſt the Turks, who made horrible ravages into Chriſtendom. The ſubtil Cardinal being ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble that when Campeius arrived, he muſt have the precedency of hi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> upon all occaſions, on the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of his Legateſhip; he privately ſent two Biſhops to Callice, as if to attend on him, who cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ningly inſinuated into Campeius, that his Journey would be ineffectual, unleſs Woolſey were joined in equal Authority with him in this matter. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon Campeius diſpatched an account thereof to Rome, and in Forty Days received a new Commiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, whereby Woolſey was made the Pope's Legate, and joint Commiſſioner with him. But Woolſey having notice of the ragged condition of his Brother's Retinue, he inſtantly ſent a great quantity of Red Cloath to Callice, wherewith to Cloath his Servants, anſwerable to the Dignity of ſo great a Perſonage. When all things were ready, Campeius paſſed the Seas and landed at Dover, and in his paſſage to London, by Woolſeys Order, he was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived with Proceſſion by the Clergy, and Magiſtrates through every Town he came to, and attended by all the Lords and Gentlemen of Kent. Being arrived at Black-heath, near Greenwich; he was there met by the Duke of Norfolk, a great number of Prelates and Clergy, and many Perſons of Quality. The Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal was brought into a Tent covered with Cloth of Gold, where he ſhifted himſelf into his Cardinals Robes, Furred with Rich Ermin; and then mount<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his Mule rid toward London, having Eight Mules more laden with his Equipage attending him, but theſe not being ſufficiently Magnificent in proud Woolſey's Eyes, he therefore ſent him twelve more to make the Pageantry more gay, through the Streets of London. The next day theſe Twenty Mules were led through the City, as if loaden with trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures,
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:57822:53"/>
and other neceſſaries, to the great admiration of the People, that the Legate ſhould be poſſeſt of ſuch vaſt Riches, but their wonder quickly ceaſed by an unlucky accident, which turned all this vain Pomp into ridicule. For in going through Cheapſide one of the skittiſh Jades, affrighted with the multitude of Spectators, broke the Collar he was led with, and running upon the other Mules put them all into ſuch diſorder, that they threw their Sumpters to the ground, which flying open, diſcovered the Cardinal's gallant Wealth, ſome of them being filled with old Cloaths, Rags old Boots and Shoes, Horſhoes, and old Iron: Others with Marybones, Scraps of Meat, Roaſted Eggs, Mouldy Cruſts, and a great deal of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Trumpery, which gave ſufficient diverſion to the People, who ſhouted and clap'd their hands at this ridiculous ſight; crying, Behold the Cardinal's Rich Treaſure. The Muliteers were much aſhamed at this diſcovery; however quietly gathering up theſe hungry relicks, they peaceably marched on: Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Campeius was conducted through the City to St. Pauls, where having beſtowed his bleſſing upon the People, he was then brought to Cardinal Woolſey's Palace, where he lodged, having his Golden Croſſes, Pillars, Guilt Axe, and Mace carried before him.</p>
            <p>And now as Cardinal Woolſey had the Power, ſo he maintained the Port and Grandeur of a Prince; of which we have this account, He had in his Hall three long Tables, to which belonged three ſeveral Officers, a Steward who was always a Prieſt, a Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurer a Knight, and a Comptroller an Eſq;. He had alſo in the Hall a Confeſſor, a Doctor, three Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhalls, three Uſhers, two Almoners, and two Grooms: In the Hall Kitchin, two Clarks, a Comptroller, a Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyor over the Dreſſer, a Clerk of the Spicery, two Cooks, twelve Labourers and Children: In the Kit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chin a Maſter Cook, Clothed in Velvet or Sattin, with a Gold Chain, two Under Cooks, ſix Labourers, four Scullery-men, two Yeomen of the Paſtry, and two
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:57822:54"/>
Paſt-layers under him: In the Larder a Yeoman and a Groom: In the Buttery two Yeomen and two Grooms: In the Eury as many: In the Cellar three Yeomen, three Pages: In the Chandery two Yeo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men: In the Wayfary, two Yeomen: In the War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drobe of the Beds, the Maſter and twenty Perſons beſides: In the Landrey, a Yeoman, a Groom, and thirteen Pages; two Yeomen Purveyors, and a Groom Purveyor: In the Bake-houſe, two Yeomen, two Grooms: In the Woodyard a Yeoman and a Groom: In the Barn a Yeoman: Two Yeomen, and two Grooms Porters at the Gate: A Yeoman of his Bing: A Maſter of his Horſe: A Clerk and Yeomen of the Stables: A Farrier and Yeoman of the Stirrup: A Malter and ſixteen Grooms, every one keeping four Geldings.</p>
            <p>His Chappel was furniſhed with a vaſt number of coſtly Ornaments, and Rich Jewels, Forty four Copes gloriouſly imbroidered with Gold and Silver, Silver Candleſticks, and other neceſſary Utenſils: In which were the following Officers, a Dean, a Sub-Dean, a Repeater of the Quire, a Goſpellor, an Epiſtoler of the Singing Prieſts, a Maſter of the Children: In the Veſtry, a Yeoman and two Grooms, beſide o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Retainers that appeared at principal Feaſts.</p>
            <p>He had likewiſe two Croſs-bearers, and two Pillar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bearers in the Great Chamber; and in his Privy-Chamber the Chief Chamberlain, Vice Chamberlain, Gentleman Uſher, twelve Waiters, ſix Gentlemen Waiters: Alſo nine or ten Lords, who had two or three Men to wait on them, and the Earl of Darby five. Then he had Gentlemen Cup-bearers, Carvers and forty Sewers of the Great and Privy Chamber, ſix Yeomen Uſhers, eight Grooms, twelve Doctors and Chaplains, daily Gueſts, beſides his own, a Clerk of his Cloſet, two Secretaries, two Clerks of his Signet, four Councellours Learned in the Law.</p>
            <p>As he was Lord Chancellour of England, he had a Riding Clerk, a Clerk of the Crown, of the Ham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per,
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:57822:54"/>
of the Check, four Footmen with gallant Live<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, a Herald at Arms, a Serjeant at Arms, a Phiſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian, an Apothecary, four Minſtrels, a Keeper of his Tents (when upon a Journey) and an Armourer. Alſo in his Houſe, a Surveyor of York, a Clark of the Green Cloth. All theſe attended daily. At Dinner he had every day eight Tables furniſht for his Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berlains and Gentlemen Officers, half of whom were young Lords, who had two or three Perſons to wait on them, and all the reſt had one. Theſe were all his inrolled Servants, (beſides Retainers and other Perſons that came about buſineſs, who daily Dined in his Hall) which according to the Liſt amounted to eight hundred Perſons. So that he was as bountiful an Houſe-keeper as any in that Age, and much ſuperior to any ſince.</p>
            <p>When he went to Weſtminſter Hall to hear Cauſes as Lord Chancellor, his Magnificence was as conſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuous as in other Offices. He was clothed in red like a Cardinal, his upper Garment all of Scarlet, or elſe fine Crimſon Taffety, or Crimſon Satrin in Grain. A black Tippet of Sables about his Neck, and an Orange in his hand, the Meat taken out, and filled with Confections to prevent the ill ſcents from the Crouds of People. Being mounted, his two Croſs bearers, and his two Pillar bearers all in fine Scarlet upon tall Horſes rid before him, then one with the Purſe and Great Seal of England. Another with his Cardinals Cap, then a train of Gentlemen with every one a Pole-ax, next the Cardinal himſelf, attended on each ſide by four Footmen. In the ſame State he uſed to go every Sunday to the Court at Greenwich in a very rich Barge, and furniſht with Yeomen all round, where when he arrived he was attended by the Lord Treaſurer, Comptroller and other principal Officers of the King's Houſe, who conveyed him in State into the King's Chamber.</p>
            <p>In this grandeur he continued for fourteen or fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen years managing all affairs of State, to whom all
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:57822:55"/>
foreign Ambaſſadors made their application, and all Addreſſes and Petitions were offered. And to ſecure this Soveraign Power which he had gained over the King's affections, he contrived all kind of pleaſures and divertiſements ſuitable to his juvenile temper, as Maſk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, Dancing, Banquetting, Young Ladies, and va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety of other Paſtimes. I ſaw the King (ſaith my Author) come one time ſuddenly to the Cardinals Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace at Weſtminſter now White-Hall which he had newly built, with a dozen Maſquers attired like Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herds in cloth of Gold and Silver imbroidered, with ſix Flambeux: And others in Vizors clothed all in Sattin. The King came thither privately by Water, and arriving at the Stairs, ſeveral great Guns were diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged, which much ſurprized the Noblemen, Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen and Ladys, a great number of whom the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal at that time was treating at a ſumptuous Supper, he himſelf ſitting at the upper end of the Table under a Cloth of State, a Gentleman and Lady being placed together through all the Tables. The Cardinal at the great noiſe, as if ignorant of the matter, deſired the Lord Chamberlain to inquire the meaning thereof. Who looking out of the Window into the Thames re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned again and told him that he believed there were ſome Noblemen and Strangers coming to the Landing <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>tairs. My Lord ſaid the Cardinal I intreat you who can ſpeak French, to go and receive them and conduct them to our Banquet, deſiring them to ſit down and be merry with us. The Lord Chamberlain went into the Hall. And with twenty Torches, and a great number of Drums and Trumpets brought them into the Dining Room, who by two together went up to the Cardinal's Chair, and ſaluted him. To whom the Lord Chamberlain ſaid, My Lord Cardinal theſe Gentlemen being Strangers, and not ſpeaking Engliſh, deſire me to inform your Grace that they hearing of your Triumphant and Magnificent Banquet this Night, and of ſuch a number of handſome Ladies as were aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembled thereto, they preſumed upon your Graces
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:57822:55"/>
goodneſs to intrude into your Palace to take a view of theſe fine beauties and to offer our ſervice to them. The Cardinal replied they were welcome, whereupon having ſaluted all the Ladies, a great Cup of Gold filled with Crown Pieces was opened and they thrown on the Table to play withal. After they had play'd ſome time, the Gentlemen came and threw down their winnings before the Cardinal being about two hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Crowns; Have at all, quoth he, and throwing a Die he won it, whereat the company ſeemed much pleaſed.</p>
            <p>Then ſaid the Cardinal, My Lord Chamberlain, Pray go and tell theſe Gentlemen that I am of opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noin there is a Nobleman among them who better de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves to ſit in this place than I, and to whom I would gladly ſurrender it according to my duty if I knew him. The Lord Chamberlain ſpoke to them in French, and they replied, That they muſt confeſs there was ſuch a Noble Perſonage among them, whom if his Grace could diſtinguiſh from the reſt he would then diſcover himſelf and accept of his Place. The Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal taking a ſtrict review of them ſaid, I believe the Gentleman with the black Beard is he, and thereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on he role up and offered him his Chair with the Cup in his hand; But it was Sir Edward Nevil who was very like King Henry, and the King ſeeing the Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal's miſtake could not forbear laughing, and pulling off his Vizor and Sir Edward's likewiſe, diſcovered him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to all his Gueſts, and then withdrawing, clothed himſelf in his Royal Robes. In which ſhort ſpace the former Banquet was clear taken away, and the Tables new covered again with perfumed Linnen, and the King and his Maſquers returning again in their rich Cloths a Royal Banquet of two hundred Diſhes was brought in, where they continued Feaſting and Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing till the next Morning.</p>
            <p>As theſe Entertainments diſcover the extream Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificence wherein the Cardinal lived, ſo they alſo ſhew the familiar temper of King Henry, whom one
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:57822:56"/>
Hiſtorian ſays, was ſo free from Pride, that he was rather too humble, at leaſt he converſed with his Subjects in a more familiar manner than is uſual with Princes. VVhich is confirmed by a Paſſage in the eleventh year of his Reign, when the Privy Council complaining that certain young Gentlemen in his Court <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>ith whom he was over-familiar were ſo Frenchified, that forgetting the reſpect due to his Royalty, they uſed many unfeemly actions and diſcourſes with him, they were thereupon with his conſent baniſhed the Court, and ſeveral other antient grave Knights and Gentlemen placed in their Rooms about the King's Perſon.</p>
            <p>Neither did the Cardinals grandeur conſiſt only in the aforementioned inſtances, but likewiſe in erecting coſtly and magnificent Houſes and Palaces, as York Place at Weſtminſter ſo named by him from his Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſhoprick, now Whitehall. Hampton Court, his ſtately buildings at Chriſt Church and Windſor. He likewiſe deſigned to have built two new Colleges in Oxford and Ipſwich the Town of his Birth, and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained a Licenſe of Pope Clement to ſuppreſs forty Monaſteries, and ſeize the Revenues thereof to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form the ſame. And for the farther ſupport of his Dignity he enjoyed at one time no leſs than ſeven rich Biſhopricks, that is York, Wincheſter, Lincoln, Tournay, Bath, VVorceſter and Hereford, ſo that he ſeemed a Monſter with ſeven Heads, each of them honoured with a Miter.</p>
            <p>He being thus imperiouſly Great, more like a Prince than a Prieſt, was continually inventing new ways for getting of Money. For he required an account of the Captains, Treaſurers and other Officers that had been imployed in paying the Souldiers in the VVars, ſome of whom he obliged to refund great ſums of their ill gotten Eſtates, who made themſelves poor to inrich him. Others compounded with him for half they were worth. But thoſe that had deceived the King, and then prodigally ſpent what they had wrongfully
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:57822:56"/>
gained, were expoſed to publick ſhame and puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. So that none ſuffered, though deeply Crimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal, but only for the Mortal Sin of Poverty. He like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe erected ſeveral Courts of Equity, as he called them, but the People named them Courts of Iniquity, in which upon pretence of relieving the poor from the rigour of the Law he brought ſuch a multitude of Cauſes into them that the other Courts of Juſtice were abandoned, and he thereby gained vaſt Treaſures to himſelf: Till at length the People perceiving that he only grew Rich and themſelves poor, and that the Verdicts in theſe Courts would not ſtand in Common Law, they utterly left them and returned to the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer courſe of Proceeding. He likewiſe erected ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther new Court which he called the Legantine Court, whereby he viſited all Biſhopricks and Monaſteries, puniſhing ſuch Clergymen as were unable to bribe him, but inriching himſelf by thoſe who were full of Money and full of Faults. By the ſame Authority he ſuppreſt ſeveral Abbies and Priories, ſeizing all their Goods and Lands, leaving only a ſmall Penſion to the Abbots and Priors, whereby he purchaſed great riches and and great hatred from the Clergy, who in many places oppoſed his Viſitor Dr. Allen (who rid in a Velvet Gown with a great Train following him) and for which they were openly curſed by Dr. Forreſt at Paul's Croſs, ſo that the Cardinal prevailed againſt them all; and cauſed the generality to murmur and complain, that by his Viſitations, Probate of Wills, granting of Faculties, Licenſes, and other Tricks, he made his conſtant revenue equal to the King's, beſides great ſums which he yearly conveyed out of the Realm to the Court of Rome.</p>
            <p>In 1517. The Citizens of London were ſo highly provoked by the multitude of French and Walloons who ſetling here underſold their goods, and thereby impoveriſht them, that they reſolved to endeavour to rid themſelves of this annoyance all at once. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon John Lincoln a Broker perſuaded one Dr. Bell
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:57822:57"/>
to repreſent this great grievance to the Lord Mayor and Aldermen in a Sermon at the Spittle on Eaſter Tueſday. The Doctor undertook the buſineſs, and took theſe words for his Text, <hi>The Heaven is the Lord's, but the Earth he hath given to the Sons of men.</hi> From hence he infer'd that this Land was given to Engliſhmen, who were obliged to defend the ſame as Birds do their Neſts, and to fight for their Country, by the Law of God, againſt all Strangers and Foreigners, who to the great trouble, vexation and ruin of the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple had now over-run the Land, and for which there was no redreſs to be had but by the Commons uniting themſelves together and extirpating them out of the City and Kingdom; and thereby avenge themſelves of the many affronts and abuſes which they had lately publickly offered them. This Sermon inflamed the Minds of the Citizens who were ſufficiently inraged before, ſo that they took all occaſions to q<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>arrel with the Foreigners, and a rumor was ſpread that the next May day would be very remarkable. The Cardinal and Council hearing of it, ordered the Lord Mayor to keep ſtrong Watches throughout the City. However on May Eve ſeveral hundreds of young Fellows got together, and in the Morning they fell to rifling the Houſes of ſeveral Foreigners, but four or five hundred of them being ſeized by the Lord Mayor, were com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to Priſon, and two hundred ſeventy eight were afterward indicted for High Treaſon, but John Lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coln only was executed, the King by the interceſſion of three Queens, Katherine Queen of England and the French Queen, and Queen of Scots his Siſters, and by the perſuaſion of Cardinal VVoolſey, without whoſe advice he would do nothing, pardoning all the reſt, who being in number four hundred men and eleven women, were brought by the Lord Mayor with Ropes about their Necks into VVeſtminſter Hall, where the Cardinal ſeverely reprimanded the Lord Mayor and Aldermen for their negligence in not ſecur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the peace of the City, and then aggravated the
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:57822:57"/>
high crime of the Priſoners, who had juſtly deſerved death. Upon which they all cried to the King for mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy who thereupon told them, That he would pardon them all, which he had no ſooner pronounced but the Priſoners gave a loud ſhout all at once, throwing up their Halters toward the top of the Hall, and ſo were diſmiſſed, and the Gibbets that had been ſet up in ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral parts of the City for their Execution were taken down, and afterwards this was named, The evil May Day.</p>
            <p>About this time Maximilian the Emperor died, and Charles V. his Son ſucceeded him in the Empire of Germany, the Kingdom of Spain and the Low Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trys. Upon which Cardinal VVoolſey was ſent over to Bruges in Flanders to condole with, and Congratu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late the young Emperor who was then Reſident there, being furniſht for his Journey in all reſpects like a Great Prince, his Attendants being clothed ſome in Crimſon, Velvet and Chains of Gold about their Necks. Others in fine Scarlet edged with black Velvet; and was received by the Emperor with as much honour as if he had been the King himſelf, having the Great Seal of England with him which was always carried before him, being ſerved upon the knee by ſeveral Engliſh Noblemen and Gentlemen, to the admiration of the Germans for his ſtrange Pride and Inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence. After which he returned into England in great Triumph, being more in fav<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1+ letters">

            <p>The French King Lewes being weary of the VVar with England, and having a great Kindneſs for the Lady Mary King Henry's Siſter, ſent Ambaſſadors to Treat of Peace, and of a Marriage with her. Both which were ſoon concluded, and the Lady was ſent to France and Crowned Queen at Paris, the French de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claring, That they thought themſelves the happieſt People in the VVorld, who had ſo good a King and fair a Queen to reign over them. But King Lewes af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter twelve weeks converſe with his moſt beautiful Lady
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:57822:58"/>
died, and his Brother Francis I. ſucceeded him, who renewed the former amity between the two Kingdoms, and for further confirmation of the ſame deſired an en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terview between them, which the Cardinal perſuaded the King to gratifie him in. VVhereupon King Henry and his Queen, attended by VVoolſey and a great number of Noblemen and Gentlemen ſailed over to Callice, and in a plain near Guiſneſs a large Palace of Timber was framed, where both the Kings met and imbraced each other with much ſeeming affection and where nothing was wanting as to Juſts, Turnaments, and the other Princely Military Exerciſes of that age, which were proper for ſuch a Royal Aſſembly.</p>
            <p>Soon after Charles the Emperor coming out of Spain to Sail into the Low Countrys, landed at Dover, where he was received and entertained by the Cardinal, and King Henry went to Canterbury to meet with him, and having ſumptuouſly treated him for a few days, the Emperor purſued his Voyage to Flanders in forty four men of VVar. A while after ſome differences happened between the French King and the Emperor, to compoſe which Cardinal VVoolſey with ſome other Noblemen were ſent, but they not prevailing. King Henry fell from the French King alledging that he had ſtirred up the Scots to make VVar with him, but King Francis laid all the blame on the Cardinal's diſſimula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and baſe treacherous practices. However the VVar proceeded becteixt the two Kingdoms, between the French King and the Duke of Bourbon, inſomuch that the Duke fled out of France to the Emperor to ſave his life, the Cardinal having notice of it, he contrived that he ſhould be King Henry's General againſt the French King. VVho thereupon raiſed a great Army againſt Burbon, and drove him into the Town of Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>via in Italy, where he was ſo cloſely beſieged that he could get no Proviſions, the Cardinal being ſecretly corrupted by the French King to withhold his pay, ſo that his Souldiers were ready to mutiny againſt their new General. Hereupon finding his caſe deſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate,
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:57822:58"/>
he reſolved to attempt an eſcape, and in the dead of the Night, he ſent part of his Forces to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tack that part of the French Camp which was weakeſt, himſelf marching out on the other ſide the City. The Guards being weak, and the Souldiers aſleep, it cauſed a very great diſturbance among the French, who turned their Cannon toward the Aſſaulters, when Burbon falling unexpectedly upon the backs of them drove them from their Cannon, which they turned upon themſelves, ſlew their Souldiers, cut down their Tents, and took Francis the French King Priſoner. This great ſucceſs ſo much incouraged theſe brave Germans, that with their Imperial Enſigns diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>played, they marched to Florence, and thence to Rome; and gave three Aſſaults to the Walls thereof in one day, in the laſt of which the Duke of Burbon was ſlain, however his Army being commanded by the Prince of Orange, and ſome other brave Generals, the Popes Palace, and the Caſtle of St. Angelo were taken, and the Pope was made Priſoner, with twenty four Cardinals that fled thither for ſecurity. The City of Rome alſo was plundred, where the Souldiers gained a very rich booty, ſo that they were overloaden with valuable Jewels Plate and Money: During the Siege the Souldiers would often Cloath a Man like the Pope, and ſet him on Horſeback with a Whore be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind him, who ſometimes bleſt, and ſometimes curſt as he rid along, and whom the Souldiers called An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichriſt.</p>
            <p>The Cardinal hearing of the misfortune of his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Pope, endeavoured by all means to induce K. Henry to declare War againſt the Emperour, and to ſhew himſelf the Defender of the Church, but the King replied; <q rend="margSglQuotes">'My Lord, I am more diſturbed at this unhappy chance, than my Tongue can expreſs; but whereas you ſay, that I as Defender of the Faith ought to be concerned therein; I do aſſure you my opinion is, That this War between the Pope and the Emperor, is not a War of Religion, or for the
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:57822:59"/>
Faith, but for Temporal Poſſeſſions and Dominions, and now Pope Clement is in the hands of Souldiers, What can I do? I can neither aſſiſt him with my Perſon, nor my People cannot reſcue him, but if my Treaſure will help him take what you think con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient.</q> Whereupon Woolſey took two hundred and forty thouſand pound out of the Exchequer, which he carried over to Callice; and from thence in 80 Waggons, and a Guard of 1200 Horſe, 60 Mules and Sumpter Horſes, and attended with a great number of Lords and Gentlemen, he conveyed this great Sum to the French Court at Amiens. Having before his going hence, ſent out Commiſſions to all the Biſhops of England, to Sing the Litany after this manner, <hi>Holy Mary pray for our Holy Pope Clement; Holy Holy Peter pray for Pope Clement,</hi> &amp;c. And thus was the Cardinal diſappointed in adviſing the King to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare the Duke of Bourbon his General, who proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed farther then he could ever have imagined.</p>
            <p>The Cardinals ambition being unlimited, he during the Impriſonment of the Pope, ſent to the Emperour to uſe his intereſt to advance him to the Papacy; but receiving a diſobliging anſwer, he grew thereupon ſo furious that he ſent the Emperor word, That if he would not endeavour his advancement, he would make ſuch a ruſtling among the Chriſtian Princes as there had not been the like for an hundred years before; though it ſhould coſt him the whole Kingdom of England. The Emperour anſwering this inſolent Letter in Print, bid the Cardinal have a care of undertaking what might both ruin himſelf and the Kingdom. Hereupon the Cardinal ſent pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Letters to Clarentius King at Arms, to join with the French Herald, and proclaim defiance to the Emperour: Who ſuſpecting that it was done with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the King's knowledge, ordered his Ambaſſadour at London to complain thereof.</p>
            <p>The King much wondered to hear of it, and the Cardinal confidently affirmed that he knew nothing
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:57822:59"/>
of the matter, but that it was the fault of Claren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

               </gap>ius, who had done it at the requeſt of the French Herald; for which he ſwore he ſhould loſe his Head when he came to Callice: Clarentius having intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence hereof, inſtantly Imbark'd at Bullen, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to Greenwich, was introduced by ſome of his Friends into the King's Preſence, before the Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal knew of it, and produced the Cardinals Letters, Commiſſion, and Inſtructions for what he had done. At which the King was ſo ſurprized that he ſtood ſome time ſilent, and then ſaid, <q rend="margSglQuotes">'O Lord Jeſus! He that I truſted moſt hath deceived me, and given a falſe account of my Affairs. Well Clarentius, for the future I ſhall take care whom I believe, for I now find I have been informed of a great many things as true, which I now find to be utterly falſe.</q> And from that time the King withdrew his favour and confidence from him.</p>
            <p>Some time before this the Cardinal ſent Letters to Doctor Stephen Gardiner, the King's Orator at Rome; (and afterward Biſhop of Wincheſter) urging him to uſe all manner of means for advancing him to the Papal Dignity, which he ſaid, nothing could induce him to aſpire to, but the vehement deſire he had to reſtore and advance the Authority of the Church, wherein no Man ſhould be more Zealous and indefatigable than himſelf. He likewiſe ingaged the French King, and King Henry to write to the Cardinals on his behalf, that he might ſucceed after the Death of Pope Clement; and vaſt Sums of Money were waſted in this buſineſs, but all the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinals ambitious thoughts proved abortive; and as he already began to ſtagger in the King's favour, ſo in a ſhort time he fell into his high diſpleaſure. For theſe extravagant expences drained the King's Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſury ſo low, that the Cardinal was compell'd to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trive new ways for filling them again. To which end he, without the King's knowledge, and by his own Authority Iſſued out Commiſſions under the
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:57822:60"/>
Great Seal, to every County in England, for taking an account of every Man's Eſtate; and he that was worth Fifty Pound, was charged to pay Four Shillings in the Pound: All that were worth above Twenty, and under Fifty Pound, Two Shillings in the Pound; and thoſe not worth Twenty Pound, to pay Twelve pence, to be paid either in Money, or Plate, making himſelf chief Commiſſioner for raiſing the ſame in and about London: The Clergy were like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe charged at four Shillings in the Pound for their Livings.</p>
            <p>Theſe unjuſt Proceedings were grievous both to the Clergy and People, who generally refuſed to comply, alledging, That theſe Commiſſions were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to Law, and againſt the Liberty of the Subject, and that it was not poſſible for thoſe who were worth more, yet to raiſe the half of what they were charged with, either in Plate or ready Money, and therefore they Petitioned the Cardinal to intercede with the King for remitting it: To whom he haughtily repli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, That he would rather have his Tongue pluck'd out of his Mouth with Pincers, then move any ſuch thing; and that he was reſolved to make them pay the utmoſt Farthing; and the Lord Viſcount Liſle one of the Commiſſioners in Hampſhire, ſending a Letter to the Cardinal, that he doubted the raiſing this Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney would occaſion an Inſurrection, he ſwore deep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that his not following the Inſtructions given him, ſhould coſt him his Head.</p>
            <p>But however the diſcontents of the People were ſo general, that the Cardinal doubting the Event, thought fit to recal thoſe Commiſſions, and to iſſue others whereby he demanded a ſixth part of every Mans Eſtate, according to the aforeſaid Rates; which he did not doubt, but they would have complied with; but on the contrary, they renewed their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints and curſed the Tyrannical Cardinal for his Arbitrary Proceedings, which at length reach'd the King's Ear. who being told that all Places were filled
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:57822:60"/>
with Clamours, Diſcontents and Mutinies, he openly proteſted that theſe Commiſſions were iſſued out without his Knowledge or Conſent; and to prevent farther Miſchief he by Proclamation vacated them, declaring that though his neceſſities were never ſo urgent, yet he would never force his Subjects to pay any Tax without their own conſent in Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, but that his wants being extream at this time, if they would of their own accord, by way of Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volence, ſupply his preſent exigencies, he ſhould ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept it as an infallible Proof of their Love and Duty toward their Soveraign.</p>
            <p>The Cardinal perceiving himſelf obliquely ſtruck at by this Proclamation, as the principal Author of theſe heavy Preſſures, and publick Grievances, he Politickly ſent for the Lord Mayor, Aldermen, and Common Council of London before him, to whom he declared, That perceiving the former Demands to be grievous to the People, he had upon his Knees (for the Love and Kindneſs he bore toward them) perſwaded the King to annul thoſe Commiſſions, and wholly to relie upon the free Gift of his People; and though the King might have juſtly demanded the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Summs as a due Debt, yet he freely releaſed them of the ſame; not doubting but they would equal if not exceed the Rates formerly required of them; the Lord Mayor and Aldermen aſſembled their reſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive Wards, and acquainted them with the King's de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire, but the Citizens abſolutely refuſed to give any thing, alledging that they had pay'd enough already, and were able to do no more, adding many oppro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brious Words againſt the Cardinal, who having no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of it, ſent for the Lord Mayor and Aldermen again, ſaying, he would examine them upon Oath what they were worth, which they alſo denied to have done; and one of their Counſellours pleaded; that the demanding or paying of any Benevolence was contrary to the Statute made in the I. Year of King Richard III. What, ſays the Cardinal, do you
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:57822:61"/>
quote a Law made by an Uſurper and Murtherer the Counſellour replied, the Act was made by the Lords and Commons of England, and not by him alone; Well, my Lord Mayor and Aldermen ſaid the Cardinal, pray tell me what you will give; My Lord pray excuſe me, ſaid the Lord Mayor, for if I ſhould offer any thing, I do not know but it may coſt me my Life; <q rend="margSglQuotes">'What for your kindneſs to your King, that's very ſtrange, ſaid the Cardinal, why then I am afraid you will conſtrain the King to force you to your Duty; well my Lord, pray go home, and tell your Neighbours, the King will be very kind to them, if they do but ſhew their good will to him in ſome competent ſumm;</q> next day the Lord Mayor called a Common Council, where it was una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimouſly Voted, that the Meeting of the Aldermen in their reſpective Wards in order to the demanding a Benevolence of the Subject was contrary to Law, and therefore not to be regarded; two or three of the Common Council moved, that every Man ſhould go to the Cardinal, and give him privately what they thought fit, but this ſo inraged the reſt, that they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired that theſe Men ſhould be for ever baniſht and excluded from ſitting in the Common Council, and ſo the Court broke up in diſorder, and every Man went to his own home.</p>

            <p>The King having daily Intelligence of theſe diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, thought it dangerous to proceed further in this matter; and therefore ſummoned a great Council to York Place (now Whitehall) where he again made a ſolemn Proteſtation, That he never deſigned to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand any thing of his People, which might tend to the breach of the Laws, and therefore deſired to know by whoſe Order thoſe Commiſſions were iſſued out, to demand the Sixth Part of every Man's E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate; the Cardinal anſwered, That it was done by the conſent of the whole Council, and by the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of the Judges, for the ſupply of the King's wants, who ſaid it might lawfully be demanded, and that he took God to witneſs he never deſigned to oppreſs the Subject, but like a true and juſt Counſellour con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trived how to inrich the King; and ſome Clergy men had told him, that it might be done by the Law of God, becauſe Joſeph cauſed Pharaoh King of Egypt, to take the Fifth Part of every Man's Goods in that Land; <q rend="margSglQuotes">'But however, ſaid he, ſince I find every Man is willing to free himſelf of this burden, I am content to take upon me the ſcandal of it, and bear the ill Will of the Multitude, for my good Will to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward the King, and to clear you my Lords and Counſellours, but the Eternal God knoweth all;</q> Well, ſaid the King, I have been informed that my Realm was never ſo rich as now, and that no trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble would have riſen upon this demand, ſince every Man would freely pay it at the firſt requeſt, but now I find all contrary; at which all held their Peace; Come, ſaid the King, I'll have no more of theſe di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturbances; pray ſend Letters to every County in England to recal the Benevolence.

Cardinal only concurred with them in it; but how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever the Common People had a mortal Averſion to him for this, and many other illegal Practices, and his Intereſt with the King ſeemed likewiſe daily to leſſen; and to diſoblige the Court, he inſinuated in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the King, that his Family was much out of Order, and thereupon undertook to reform the ſame by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moving ſeveral Officers and Servants from their Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and putting ill Men in their Rooms; He like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe preſented his Mannor and Palace of Hampton-Court to the King, a little to ſweeten him; in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compence of which, the King gave him leave to keep his Court in his Palace at Richmond, wherein King Henry VIIth did ſo extreamly delight; which yet made him the more abhorr'd both by the Courtiers and Common People, who reproachfully ſaid, <hi>Who would ever have thought to have ſeen a Butcher's Dog lye in the Palace of Richmond.</hi>

            <p>Cardinal Campeius being again arrived in England, the two Legates cauſed a ſtately Court to be erected in Black Fryers, and their Commiſſion being read, the Cryer called, Henry King of England, who anſwered, Here: Then he cried, Katherine Queen of England come into the Court; the Queen made no anſwer, but riſing out of her Chair, came to the King and kneeling at his Feet, ſhe in broken Engliſh ſpake thus to him;</p>
            <p>
               <q rend="margSglQuotes">'Sir, I beſeech you do me Juſtice and right, and take ſome Pity upon me; I am a Poor Woman and a ſtranger Born out of your Dominions, having here no indifferent Council, and leſs Aſſurance of Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip; Alas Sir, how have I offended you, that you thus intend to ſhorten my Days; I take God to witneſs, I have been to you a True and Loyal Wife, ever conformable to your Will, and never contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicting your deſires; but have always complied and ſubmitted to your Pleaſure in all things, without the leaſt grudging or diſcontent: For your ſake I have loved all Men whom you loved, whether they were my Friends or Enemies; I have been your Wife theſe twenty Years, by whom you have had many Children; and when I firſt came to your Bed, God and your own Conſcience knows that I was a Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin: If you can prove any diſhoneſty by me, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by you may lawfully put me from you, I am willing to

leave you with ſhame and rebuke, but if I am guilty of none, I beſeech you ſet me have Juſtice at your hands. The King your Father was a man of excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent VViſdom in his time, and accounted a ſecond Solomon, and the King of Spain Ferdinand my Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther was reckoned one of the wiſeſt Princes that has reigned there for many years. And doubtleſs they had both as wiſe Counſellors as any are at this day. And who could never have imagined when you and I were Married that ſuch new deviſes ſhould have been invented as to compel me to ſubmit to the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees of this Court, from whom I may expect to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive wrong, and may be condemned for not anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, but not to have Right adminiſtred to me, ſince I can have no indifferent Council aſſigned me to plead my Cauſe, but muſt make choice of your own Subjects who know your Mind and dare not contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict your VVill. Therefore I moſt humbly beſeech you ſpare till I know how my Friends in Spain will adviſe me. But if you will not, you may do your pleaſure.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Then making a low Curteſie to the King ſhe depart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out of the Court; Upon which the King bid the Crier call her back which he did, but ſhe refuſed to return, ſaying, <hi>It is no indifferent Court to me, I will not go back.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>VVhen ſhe was gone the King declared to the Court, that ſhe had been a loyal loving and obedient Wife to him, and was endued with all the good qualities and virtues of a Woman either of her Dignity, or of any meaner Eſtate. After which Cardinal Woolſey ſaid, <q rend="margSglQuotes">'I humbly beſeech your Highneſs to declare to this audience whether I have been the firſt and chief Mover of this matter to your Highneſs or not, for I am much ſuſpected of all men.</q> The King declared he was not, but rather adviſed the contrary, but that the ſpecial cauſe that moved him in this matter was a certain ſcruple of Conſcience upon ſome words ſpoken by the Biſhop of Bayon the French Ambaſſador upon
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:57822:63"/>
a debate about a Marriage between the Lady Mary his only Daughter, and the Duke of Orleans ſecond Son to the French King, and the Biſhop deſiring time to conſult his Maſter whether the Lady Mary were Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitimate as being born of his Brother Arthur's Wife. This diſcourſe ſo affected him, conſidering he had no Heirs Male, they all dying as ſoon as born, that he judged God Almighty was diſpleaſed at this match. Hereupon, conſidering the ſtate of the Realm, and diſpairing to have any more Children by his Queen, whereby the Kingdom might be endangered for want of a Prince to ſucceed him, and to quiet his own mind which was toſſed with the Waves of troubleſome doubts, he deſired to have the opinion of the Learned Prelates and Paſtors of the Realm whether by the Laws of God and the Land, he might take another Wife (if his firſt Marriage were not Legal) by which he might have more Iſſue. Affirming in the preſence of God that he had no diſlike to the Perſon nor Age of the Queen, with whom he could be content to live if it were the Will of God. Nor out of carnal Concu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſcence or deſire of change, but only for the ſetling of his Conſcience.</p>
            <p>After this the Court ſate daily, where many ſubtile and learned Arguments and Diſputations touching the lawfulneſs or inſufficiency of the Marriage were hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, but the Queen Appealing to the Court of Rome for deciding this Queſtion, from which ſhe could not be diſſuaded; The King expected a final <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>raged the King who now per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived their diſſimulation, and that they purpoſely contrived delays, that from this time he had a mortal hatred againſt his falſe Favourite Woolſey, whom from a contemptible Birth and Eſtate, he had pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer'd to be Abbot of St. Albans, his Almoner, a Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſellor of State, Biſhop of Wincheſter, Durham, Lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coln, Bath, Worceſter, Hereford, Tournay, Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſhop of York, an Ambaſſador to Kings and Princes,
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:57822:64"/>
his Chancellor and a Cardinal, who by contriving this buſineſs, thereby to render himſelf Gracious with the King, and to be revenged of his Enemies, brought ruin and deſtruction at length upon himſelf.</p>
            <p>For notwithſtanding the King excuſed him from being the Author of this ſcruple of Conſcience, yet Woolſey ſeemed at firſt very forward in promoting it, and to incline to have it determined according to the King's Mind, but afterward perceiving the fatal con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequences which might enſue thereupon, ſo as at length to ſhake the Infallibility of the Papal Chair, if the Caſe were decided according to the Scriptures, he declined proceeding therein. For if the Marriage was unlawful, then the former diſpenſation of Pope Julius was null and void, and if it was lawful then the Judgment of ſo many learned Univerſities as had gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven their Opinion to the contrary, was falſe. In this difficulty his Collegue Campeius went out of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom before the day of the final determination of the matter, leaving Woolſey to bear all the weight of the King's Indignation.</p>
            <p>Another cauſe of the Cardinal's oppoſing the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vorce was, that the King during the Ventilation of this Knotty Caſe, had fallen in love with Mrs. Ann Bullen, who he after Married, one of the Maids of Honour to Queen Katherine, and Daughter to Sir Tho. Bullen, (afterward Earl of Wiltſhire) a Lady no way favourable to his Pontifical Grandeur, nor to the Superſtitions of the Church of Rome. So that when the King diſcovered his great affection for her, the Cardinal upon his Knees uſed many arguments to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuade him from it. Which the Lady had notice of, and therefore when the King once entertained him at a great Feaſt, She being preſent, among other diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſes ſaid, <q rend="margSglQuotes">'Sir is it not a marvellous thing to think into what great Debt this great Cardinal hath brought you, to all your Subjects?</q> How ſo, quoth the King. Why, ſays ſhe, there is not a man in your whole Kingdom worth an hundred pounds but he hath made

you a Debtor to him. (Meaning the Loan which the Cardinal had borrowed for the King ſome years be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, and which he procured the Houſe of Commons, who were moſt the King's Servants, to diſcharge with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out repaying a farthing, to the great loſs of the People): Nay, added ſhe, how many violencies and oppreſſions is he guilty of, to your great diſhonour and diſgrace, in divers parts of the Realm, ſo that if my Lord of Norfolk, my Lord of Suffolk, my own Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, or any other Nobleman had done but half ſo much wrong as he, they well deſerved to loſe their Heads. Then I perceive, ſaid the King, that you are no friend of my Lord Cardinal's. Why Sir, quoth ſhe, I have no cauſe, no more have any others that love the King. Neither has your Grace any reaſon to be kind to him, conſidering his indirect and unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful actions. The King ſaid no more, but went away.</p>
            <p>The Council and the Nobility perceiving that the King's Heart was eſtranged from Woolſey, they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved if poſſible utterly to depreſs him, for he was ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally hated for his exceſſive Pride, inſulting Tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, grievous oppreſſions, monſtrous injuſtice, unſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiable covetouſneſs, abominable debauchery, malicious and cruel revenge, and likewiſe for his ſecret In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treagues with the Pope and Church of Rome, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the King's Authority and Prerogative Royal in all things touching the Church and Clergy were made void. Hereupon they concluded him guilty of a Prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munire, and that conſequently he had forfeited all his Promotions, Spiritual and Temporal, with all the reſt of his Eſtate and likewiſe his Liberty to the King. Theſe crimes the Nobility drew into Articles which were ingroſſed and ſigned with their hands, and then delivered to the King. Which were as followeth:</p>
            <p>I. That by ſubtil and indirect means he had procu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red himſelf, without the King's conſent, to be made a Legate, whereby he deprived the Biſhops and Clergy of England, of all juriſdiction in Eccleſiaſtical Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs.

he uſed the inſolent ſtile of <hi>Ego &amp; Rex meus,</hi> I and my King, as if the King were his Inferior or Servant. III. That he unchriſtianly and abominably ſlandered the Church of England to the Pope, affirming, <hi>That they were Reprobates and without Faith,</hi> and that there was an abſolute neceſſity for him to be made a Legate to reduce them to the true belief. IV. That without the King's conſent he carried the Great Seal of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land to Flanders only for vain Glory, and to the great damage of the Subjects of England. V. That he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing filthily powdered with the French Pox, by reaſon of his exceſſive Letchery and Debauched Life, did oft preſume to diſcourſe with, and caſt his unwholeſome Breath into the King's Face. VI. That he cauſed the Cardinals Hat to be put on the King's Coin. VII. That to obtain his Dignities he had conveyed out of the Realm 240000 <hi>l.</hi> at one time, and incredible ſums at other times: And to inrich the K. again had of his own accord ſent out Commiſſions for exacting infinite ſums contrary to Law, which raiſed hatred and inſurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons among the People againſt the King.</p>
            <p>Theſe with many other Articles being charged againſt VVoolſey, he with his own Hand freely Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed to them, confeſſing all of them to be true, throwing himſelf upon the King's mercy, hoping he would have forgiven him, but afterward finding that he diſpoſed of his Offices, and part of his Eſtate, he ſecretly procured a Bull from the Pope to Curſe and Excommunicate the King, unleſs he would reſtore to him all his Dignities and Lands, who likewiſe decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red that the King himſelf nor no other authority on Earth but the Pope alone, had power to puniſh any Clergyman for any crime or offence whatſoever. This Bull, with the Letters ſent him by ſeveral Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinals, to incourage him not to faint or be diſcoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, aſſuring him of his Reſtoration, and that the King ſhould be certainly croſt in the buſineſs of his Marriage, ſo animated the Cardinal that he did not doubt of his re-advancement, if not with, yet without the King's
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:57822:65"/>
conſent, ſo that he made great preparations for his in ſtalment into his Archbiſhoprick of York, which he deſigned to ſolemnize with extraordinary Pomp and Magnificence, to which purpoſe he had erected a ſtate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſeat of an extraordinary height in that Cathedral, reſembling the Throne of the King, and writ Letters to the Nobility and Gentry of the North, wherein he kindly invited them to be preſent at his Inſtalment, for which he had made extraordinary proviſion of all manner of Dainties.</p>
            <p>Theſe mighty preparations being made without ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainting the King therewith, and ſeeming to be in contempt of him, who had been ſo kind to allow him the Biſhopricks of York and VVincheſter though juſtly forfeited to the Crown, cauſed the King to put a ſtop to his aſpiring purpoſes, ſo that he ſent order to the Earl of Northumberland to Arreſt him, and deliver him to the Earl of Shrewſbury Lord High Steward of the Houſhold. The Earl accordingly went to his Mannor of Caywood about ſeven Miles from York, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing into his Chamber told him, he arreſted him for High Treaſon in the King's name: The Cardinal was ſo aſtoniſht that for ſome time he ſtood ſpeechleſs, at length recovering himſelf, he ſaid, You have no power to Arreſt me, who am both a Cardinal and a Legate, and alſo a Peer of the See Apoſtolick of Rome, and ought not to be Arreſted by any Tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Power, for I am Subject to none, and none I will obey. Well, ſaid the Earl, here is the King's Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion, and therefore I charge you to ſubmit. I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member when I was ſworn Warden of the Marches you your ſelf told me that with my ſtaff only, I might Arreſt any man under the degree of a King, and now I am ſtronger, for I alſo have a Commiſſion for what I have done. The Cardinal at length recollecting him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, Well, my Lord, ſaid he, I am contented to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit, but though by negligence I fell into the danger of a Praemunire, whereby I forfeited all my Lands and Goods to the Law, yet my Perſon was under the
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:57822:66"/>
King's Protection, and I was pardoned that offence, therefore I much wonder I ſhould be now Arreſted, eſpecially conſidering I am a Member of the Sacred College at Rome, on whom no Temporal Man ought to lay hands; Well I find the King wants good Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſellors about him. He was then kept cloſe in one of his Chambers, and Dr. Auſtin his Phyſician was at the ſame time Arreſted for High Treaſon and ſent to the Tower. The Cardinal's Goods were all ſeized, and his Servants diſcharged: And he himſelf was ſo de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected that he continually lamented his hard fortune with ſuch a mean and unbecoming forrow as ſuch haughty Spirits are commonly ſubject to when they fall into adverſity, as having neither good Conſciences nor manly Courage to ſupport their drooping Spirits. From hence he was carried to the Earl of Shrewſbury's to Sheffeild, where he continued till the King ſent Sir William Kingſton Captain of the Guard and Conſtable of the Tower to bring him to London, the ſight of whom ſo daunted him that he redoubled his lamenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and would receive no comfort, and much doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing he ſhould loſe his Head, he took ſo ſtrong a Purge, or poyſonous Potion, for fear of being brought to open puniſhment for his many enormities, as in a few days put an end to his Life at Leiceſter Abbey in his Jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney toward London.</p>
            <p>Being near his end he called Sir William Kingſton to him and ſaid, <q rend="margSglQuotes">'Pray preſent my Duty to his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty, who is a Noble and Gallant Prince, and of a reſolved Mind, for he will venture the loſs of his Kingdom rather than be contradicted in his deſires. I do aſſure you I have ſometimes kneeled three hours together to diſſande him from his reſolutions but could never prevail, therefore you had need take care what you put into his Head for you can never get it out again. And now Mr. Kingſton, had I but ſerved God as diligently as I have ſerved the King he would never have forſaken me in my Gray Hairs, but this is the juſt reward that I receive for all my
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:57822:66"/>
pains and labour, who neglected the Service of God, and ſtudied only to pleaſe and humour my Prince.</q>
            </p>
            <p>He then proceeded to vilifie the Proteſtants whom he named Helliſh Lutherans, and that the King ſhould take care to ſuppreſs and extirpate them, as being the occaſion of Rebellions and Inſurrections in Bohemia and England in King Richard II's time, and other places, and that theſe Seditions and Hereſies would ruin Holy Church, and bring deſtruction upon the Realm. About eight a Clock at Night he gave up the Ghoſt, as himſelf had predicted the day before. A Perſon in whoſe Arm he died, affirmed, that his Body when dead was as black as pitch, and ſo heavy that ſix men could hardly carry it, and ſtank ſo horribly that they were forced to bury him that very night be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it was day. At which time ſo great a Tempeſt of Wind, and ſuch a lothſome ſtench aroſe, that all the Torches were blown out, and the Corps being haſtily thrown into the Grave was there left, without Tomb, Monument, or Remembrance. Of which the Poet thus writes,
<q>
                  <l>And though from his own Store Woolſey might have</l>
                  <l>A Palace or a College for his Grave,</l>
                  <l>Yet here he lies interr'd as if that all</l>
                  <l>Of him to be remembred were his Fall:</l>
                  <l>Nothing but Earth to Earth, no pompous weight</l>
                  <l>Upon him but a Pebble or a Quait.</l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>One Hiſtorian thus concludes his Story. Thus Lived and thus Died this great Cardinal, who was Proud and Ambi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

VVhoſe Death made the King joyful, the Nobles jocund, and the People glad. This happened in 1530.</p>
            <p>Thus died this mighty Prelate who though guilty of
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:57822:67"/>
ſo many horrid crimes, yet to the laſt hour pretended much zeal for the Church, breathing forth Death and murder againſt the Proteſtants, and charging them with thoſe Rebellions and Diſturbances which the Clergy only were the cauſe of, by their violent Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels, and their bloody, cruel, illegal and arbitrary de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees and practices; Inſomuch that Sir Richard Baker in his Chronicle of England, writing the Character of King Henry VIII. ſays thus: But it will be injurious to charge all the Blood ſpilt in his Reign to his account. They were the bloody Biſhops that made thoſe bloody Laws, and the bloody Clergy that put them in exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution, the King oft-times ſcarce knowing what was done, and when he heard of ſome of them, he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamly condemned their barbarous cruelty.</p>

But that thoſe that proceed from mean and abject Families are oftentimes indued with ſuch ſingular VViſdom, Dexterity and Induſtry that they riſe to high preferment and authority. VVe may likewiſe obſerve, That though his Predeceſſor VVoolſey could not bear the great Fortune to which he arrived with any moderation, but by his Pride and Inſolence became diſtaſtful to all men, yet our great Cromwell on the contrary carried an even Sail in all conditions, being neither elated with Proſperity, nor
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:57822:67"/>
depreſt when fallen from it. Laſtly, We may hence conclude with the Wiſe man, that all things happen alike to all in this life, Woolſey the greateſt ſlave to Vice, and Cromwell a Perſon of the moſt ſublime Virtue, being both Favourites to the ſame King, both falling into diſgrace with him, and both expiring by a fatal Fall.</p>
            <p>Thomas Cromwell was the Son of a Blackſmith at Putney in Surrey, to whom may be applied what Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venal ſaid of Demoſthenes the famous Orator, who had the ſame Original:
<q>
                  <l>Whom his poor Father, blear-ey'd with the Soot</l>
                  <l>Of Sparks which from the burning Iron did ſhoot,</l>
                  <l>From Coals, Tongs, Anvil, and ſuch Blackſmiths Tools,</l>
                  <l>And dirty Forge, ſent to the Grammar Schools.</l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>His Father educated him according to his mean abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, and though his low condition was at firſt a great hindrance to his promotion, yet ſuch was his pregnancy of wit, his ſolid judgment, his ready elocution, his indefatigable diligence, his couragious Heart and his active Hand, that ſo many excellencies could not lye long concealed, inſomuch that though he were with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Friends or Money, yet nothing being too difficult for his Wit and Induſtry to compaſs, nor for his Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity and Memory to retain, he ſoon got into Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment. For having paſſed over his Youth with the common diverſions of that ſtate, when he grew toward man he had a great inclination to travel abroad and learn experience in the World, and gain thoſe Languages which might be ſerviceable to him in the future courſe of his Life. Whereupon going over to Antwerp he was there retained by the Engliſh Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants for their Secretary.</p>
            <p>It happened about this time that the People of Boſton in Lincolnſhire thought fit to ſend to Rome to renew the Great and Little Pardon which formerly belonged to a Church in their Town, by which they
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:57822:68"/>
found much advantage from thoſe who came to have the benefit of the remiſſion of their Sins by them, which were no ſmall number of ſuperſtitious Zealots. And being very ſenſible that all things at Rome were to be purchaſed only by Money, they ſent one Jeffery Chambers with a round ſum upon this notable errand, who in his Journey coming to Antwerp, and much doubting his ability for managing ſo weighty a buſineſs, he made a viſit to Mr. Cromwell, and giving him an account of the affair, he was very importunate with him to accompany him. Cromwell knew very well the many Intreagues of the Roman Court, and the unreaſonable expences they muſt be at among thoſe Spiritual Cormorants; however having ſome know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the Italian Tongue, and being not yet well ſetled in Religion, he was at length prevailed with to adventure with him. When they arrived at Rome, Cromwell finding it very difficult to get his Pardons diſpatcht, and being unwilling to ſpend much time or money, he at length perceived that nothing was to be done without making a Preſent of ſome Rarity to the Pope; and hearing that he was much delighted with delicate new found Diſhes, he prepared ſeveral fine Diſhes of Jelly of divers colours according to the Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh faſhion, which were not as yet known at Rome. Cromwell obſerving his time when the Pope was new<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly returned to his Pallace from Hunting, he with his Engliſh Companions, approached him with their Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents, which they introduced with ſinging in Engliſh the three Mans Song (as it is called): The Pope won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring at the Song, and underſtanding they were Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhmen, and came not empty handed, ordered them to be called in. Cromwell making low obeyſance, preſented his jolly junkets, being ſuch as, he ſaid, none but Kings and Princes in England uſe to Eat, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiring his Holineſs to accept of them from him and his Companions, who were poor Suitors at his Court, and had preſented them as Novelties proper only for his Table. Pope Julius obſerving the ſtrangeneſs of
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:57822:68"/>
the Diſhes bid a Cardinal taſte them, which he liked ſo well and the Pope after him, that inquiring what their buſineſs was, and then requiring them to give him an account how theſe Jellies were made, he with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out delay Sealed both the Great and Leſſer Pardons, and fully diſpatcht them.</p>
            <p>All this while Cromwell had no great ſenſe of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, but was wild, youthful and without regard to any thing that was ſerious, as he often declared to Cranmer Archbiſhop of Canterbury, being very dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent (with Jeffery Chambers) in publiſhing the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dons of Boſton in all the Churches as he travelled, and ſerving ſometime under the Duke of Burbon at the Siege of Rome. Thus he continued for ſome years, till at length by learning the New Teſtament of Eraſmus by Heart in his going to and from Rome, he began to come to a better underſtanding. About this time Cardinal Woolſey began to grow very great in England, ruling all under, or rather over the King, ſo that Perſons of the briſkeſt Wits and noted Abili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties addreſt themſelves to him for imployments. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong whom Thomas Cromwell was by him prefer'd to be his Chancellor; and at the ſame time Sir Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas More and Stephen Gardiner were likewiſe taken into the Cardinals Family, being all three almoſt of one Age, one ſtanding in Learning, not much unequal in Wit, and their advancements ariſing from the ſame foundation, though afterward their Studies, Diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and Fortune were greatly different.</p>
            <p>The Cardinal deſigning to erect a famous Colledge in Oxford called then Frideſwide, now Chriſt Church, obtained leave from the Pope to ſuppreſs ſeveral ſmall Monaſteries and Priories in divers parts of the Realm, and to convert the Revenues thereof to his own uſe. He committed the charge of this buſineſs to Cromwell, who uſed ſuch induſtry and expedition therein as was diſpleaſing to ſome Great Perſons both of the Nobility and Clergy. But afterward the Cardinal who had riſen ſuddenly, began to fall as faſt, firſt from his
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:57822:69"/>
Chancellorſhip, which was beſtowed on Sir Thomas More, and then falling into a Praemunire, his Family was diſſolved; Cromwel being thereby out of Office, endeavoured to be retained in the Kings Service; and Sir Chriſtopher Hales Maſter of the Rolls, though an earneſt Papiſt, yet had ſo great a kindneſs for him, that he recommended him to the King, as a Man moſt fit to be imployed by him; but Cromwel had been ſo miſrepreſented by the Popiſh Clergy, for his forward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in defacing their Monaſteries and Altars, that the King abhorr'd the very name of him, but the Lord Ruſſel Earl of Bedford being preſent (whoſe Life Cromwel had ſaved at Bononia in Italy, where he was ſecretly imploy'd in the King's Affairs, and was in great danger to be taken, had he not been ſecured by Cromwel's Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licy) who not forgetting his Benefactor, gave him an account of the whole matter, and ſince His Majeſty had now to do with the Pope his great Enemy; he was of Opinion, there was not a fitter Inſtrument for the King's purpoſe than he, and told him wherein: The King hereupon was willing to ſpeak with him, of which Cromwel having Private notice, he got in readineſs the Oath, which the Engliſh Biſhops took to the Pope at their Conſecration; and being called in, after pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his Duty to the King, anſwered to all Points de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded of him, whereby he made it plainly appear, that his Royal Authority was diminiſht within his own Kingdom by the Pope and his Clergy, who having ſworn Allegiance to the King, were afterward diſpenſed with for the ſame, and ſworn anew to the Pope, ſo that he was but half King, and they but half Subjects in his own Realm, which was derogatory to his Crown, and abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely contrary to the Common Law of England, and that his Majeſty might therefore juſtly make himſelf rich with their forfeited Eſtates, if he pleaſed to take the preſent occaſion.</p>
            <p>The King was very Attentive to his Diſcourſe, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially the laſt part of it, and demanded whether he would juſtifie what he ſaid, He affirmed he would,
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:57822:69"/>
producing the Oath they had taken to the Pope, which the King having read, he took his Ring off his Finger, and firſt admitting him into his Service by the Advice of his Council, ſent him therewith to the Convocation then ſitting; Cromwel coming boldly with the King's Signet into the Convocation Houſe, and placing him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf among the Biſhops (Warham being Archbiſhop of Canterbury) declared to them, the Authority of the King, and the Obedience due from Subjects, eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly from Biſhops and Clergymen to the Laws of the Land, which are neceſſarily provided for the Benefit and quiet of the Commonwealth, which Laws notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, they had all highly tranſgreſſed to the great Derogation of the King's Royal Dignity, and thereby brought themſelves into a Praemunire, not only in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenting to the Power Legantine of the late Cardinal Woolſey, but alſo by Swearing to the Pope, contrary to their Allegiance to their Soveraign Lord the King, whereby they had forfeited all their Spiritual and Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral Eſtates, real or perſonal.</p>
            <p>The Biſhops were amazed at firſt to hear this bold Charge, and began to deny it, but Cromwell ſhewing them the very Copy of their Oath taken to the Pope at their Conſecration, made the matter ſo plain; that they began to ſhrink, and deſired time to adviſe about it; but however before they could get clear of this Praemunire, the two Provinces of Canterbury and York were obliged by Act of Parliament, to pay the King one hundred eighteen thouſand, eight hundred and forty Pounds.</p>
            <p>Cromwel after this came into great Favour with the King, who made him a Knight, Maſter of his Jewel Houſe, and a Privy Councellour, and ſoon after Knight of the Garter, Earl of Eſſex, Lord Privy Seal, and Lord Great Chamberlain of England; and laſtly, he was conſtituted Vicegerent in all Eccleſiaſtical Affairs, by Virtue whereof, both in Parliament and elſewhere, he had the precedence of the Archbiſhop of Canterbu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry: This Authority he uſed upon all occaſions, for the
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:57822:70"/>
extirpating Romiſh Superſtition and Idolatry, to which he always was an utter Enemy, and for which there was a fair occaſion offered: For the King being inra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged againſt the Pope, for refuſing to annul his Marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age with Queen Katherine, though he had the Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of nineteen Univerſities on his ſide, he reſolved to have the matter determined by the Clergy of his own Kingdom; and having ſummoned a Convocation, they after mature debate, declared the Marriage null and void from the beginning, and confirmed the Kings ſecond Marriage with Queen Ann of Bullen, which he had conſummated ſome time before: And a Parli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ament being called, ſeveral Acts were paſſed againſt the Popes Supremacy, whereby all Clergymen that ſhould make any appeal to Rome, were declared guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of a Praemunire, and that the King ſhould have pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to viſit, examine and reform all the Monaſteries and Nunneries of the Kingdom, and ſhould give Licenſes for electing Biſhops to all Vacancies, without the Popes conſent or approbation, and declaring the King Supream Head on earth of the Church of England; af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter which, a ſtop was put to the Perſecutions which the Proteſtant Miniſters had ſuffered, many of whom were cruelly burnt by the Popiſh Clergy, for want of ſtronger Arguments to convince them: The Nobility and Gentry were generally well ſatisfied with this change, but the Body of the People, who were more un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Power of the Prieſts, were by them poſſeſt with great fears of a change of Religion, being told that the King had now joined himſelf with Hereticks, and that Queen Ann, Cranmer now Archbiſhop of Canterbury, and the Lord Cromwel favoured them: For the Monks and Friers ſaw themſelves left at the King's Mercy, the Trads of new Saints was now at an end, they had alſo ſome Intimations, that Cromwel was forming a Project for ſuppreſſing Monaſteries, ſo that in Confeſſions and Diſcourſes, they infuſed into the People a diſlike of the Kings Proceedings, which prevail'd ſo far upon them, as they afterward broke out into formidable In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrections
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:57822:70"/>
and Rebellions in divers Parts of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom.</p>
            <p>Cromwel by his Vicegerency, had precedence of all next the Royal Family, and as the King came in the Popes Room, ſo the Vicegerents Authority was in all Points the ſame, that the Legates had in the time of Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery; the firſt Act of Cromwel's after his being Vicar General, was (with a Delegation of the Kings Supre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macy to him) to viſit all the Monaſteries and Churches in England, of which the Biſhops and Abbots were ſo jealous, that of their own accord before any Law was made about it, they ſwore to maintain the Kings Supremacy; however the Viſitation went on through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out England, and in many places monſtrous diſorders were found, as the Sin of Sodomy in ſome, barbarous Murthers and Cruelties in others, Tools for falſe Coin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in others, and great Factions and Diviſions in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny: The Report that was made, contained many other abominable Crimes not fit to be named; hereupon Cromwel procured the Parliament to paſs an Act, that thirty Perſons Spiritual and Temporal, ſuch as his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty ſhould impower under his Great Seal, ſhould have Authority to make and eſtabliſh Laws and Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances Eccleſiaſtical, which ſhould be obligatory upon all the Subjects of this Realm; and likewiſe that all Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious Houſes, either Monaſteries, Priories or Nunne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, whoſe revenues did not exceed two hundred pounds a Year ſhould be ſuppreſt and diſſolved, and all their Poſſeſſions and Lands ſetled on the Crown for ever: And the Reaſons alledged for doing this were, becauſe theſe Houſes were erected upon groſs abuſes and ſubſiſted by them, the Foundation of all their Wealth being founded upon the belief of Purgatory, and of the Virtue that was in Maſſes to redeem Souls out of it, and that theſe eaſed the Torments of departed Souls, and at laſt delivered them out of them, ſo it paſt among all for a piece of Piety to Parents, and of care for their own Souls and Families to endow thoſe Houſes with ſome Lands, upon Condition they ſhould

have Maſſes ſaid for them, the number of which were uſually according to the value of the Gift; this was like to have drawn the whole Wealth of the Nation into thoſe Houſes, had not ſome reſtraint been put to that Superſtition; they alſo perſwaded the People, that the Saints interceded for them, and would kindly accept offerings made at their Shrines, and the greater they were, the more earneſtly would they uſe their Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt for them: The credulous Vulgar meaſuring the Court of Heaven by thoſe on Earth, believed that Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents might be very prevalent there; ſo that every new Saint muſt have new Gifts preſented him: Likewiſe ſome Images were believed to have an extraordinary Virtue in them, and Pilgrimages to them were much extolled, and there was great Contention among the Monaſteries, every one magnifying their one Saints, Images, and Reliques above others; the Wealth that theſe Follies brought in occaſioned great Corruptions, ſo that the Monks and Friers were very debaucht, and very Ignorant: And the begging Friers under the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance of Poverty, courſe Diet, and Cloathing gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed much eſteem, and became almoſt the only Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers and Confeſſort in the World, but not being able to conceal their Vices, they were now fallen under much Scandal, and a general Diſeſteem, and the King de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigning to create new Biſhopricks, thought it neceſſary in Order thereto to make uſe of ſome of their Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nues, and that the beſt way to bring them into his hands, would be to expoſe their vices, that ſo they might quite loſe the eſteem they yet had with ſome, and it would be the leſs dangerous to ſuppreſs them.</p>
            <p>Cromwel was imploy'd in this Reforming Work, and for removing all Images and Superſtitious Pictures out of the Churches; many of the Abbots ſurrendred their Monaſteries, and in moſt Houſes, the Viſitors made the Monks ſign a Confeſſion of their former Vices and Diſorders, in which they acknowledged their Idleneſs, Gluttony and Senſuality, for which the Pit of Hell was ready to ſwallow them up; others acknowledged that
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:57822:71"/>
they were ſenſible that the manner of their former pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended Religion, conſiſting only in ſome Dumb Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies; whereby they were blindly led without any Knowledge of God's Laws, and being exempted from the Authority of their own Biſhops and wholly ſubje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting themſelves to a Forreign Power, who took no care to reform their abuſes, it had occaſioned great diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orders among them; but the moſt perfect way of Life revealed by Chriſt and his Apoſtles, being now diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered to them, they thought it very fit, that they ſhould be governed by the King their Supream Head, and therefore reſigned their Abbies to him; So that in the whole, one hundred fifty nine Reſignations were made to the King before the Meeting of the next Parli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ament, who made an Act for the Total Diſſolution of all the Abbies in England, the Rents of which were then valued at, being one hundred thirty two thouſand, ſix hundred and ſeven pound ſix ſhillings four pence, but they were worth above ten times as much in true value.</p>
            <p>Theſe Proceedings againſt the Pope and Holy Church cauſed the Rude, Ignorant, and wilful People in Lincolnſhire to aſſemble in Arms to the number of twenty thouſand: The King levied a ſtrong Army, and went in Perſon to ſuppreſs them, and approaching them, they ſent him an humble Petition; that if he would reeſtabliſh the Monaſteries, and the Popes Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, they would freely lay down their Arms and return to their Duty; hut the King diſdaining theſe Ruſticks ſhould dictate Politicks to him, rejected their Petition, ſending them Word, that if they did not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly deliver up a hundred of the principal Rebels in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his hands, he would immediately fall upon them with the utmoſt Fury, and Sacrifice them all to his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentment; This daring Reſolution, ſo daunted the Hearts of this undiſciplined Multitude, that their Lead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers expecting each would deliver the other up to the King, they ſecretly deſerted them and returned home, but Captain Cobler their Chief Commander, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:57822:72"/>
Dr. Makarel and ſome other being taken were executed according to their merits, and the Common People being left without Officers made haſte home, and were pardoned by the King. This was ſucceeded by another Inſurrection in the North, where 40000 got together upon the ſame pretences, calling them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves <q rend="margSglQuotes">'The Holy Pilgrims, who intended nothing but the eſtabliſhing of the true Religion, and reſtoring the Rights of Holy Church.</q> The Dukes of Norfolk and Suffolk were ordered to ſuppreſs theſe brainſick Zealots, who ſeemed very joyful they were to fight, not doubting of ſucceſs in this Religious War, but the Night before the intended day of Battel a little Brook which ran between the Armies, and might have been paſſed over dry foot, grew ſo broad by the next Morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by a violent Rain which fell, that they could not approach each other, which being reckoned by both Parties a great Miracle, the Rebels upon promiſe of free pardon quietly departed home. In theſe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motions thoſe men whoſe profeſſion was only their Books and their Beeds, miſtaking the Command of Chriſt, <hi>To ſell their Coats and buy a Sword,</hi> came armed into the Field, and being taken, ſeveral Abbots, Monks and Prieſts were executed.</p>
            <p>The Kingdom being again ſetled in peace Cromwell proceeded in the Work of Reformation, and becauſe the People ſeemed diſcontented that the abuſe of theſe Monaſteries ſhould be turn'd to the utter ruin of them, from whence they uſed to have relief and alms, There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Cromwell thought fit to make them ſenſible of the Cheats and Tricks which the Prieſts had impoſed upon them. And many Impoſtures about Relicks and Wonderful Images or Roods were now diſcovered, to which Pilgrimages had been formerly made. As at Reading where they ſhewed the Wing of the Angel that brought over thither the point of the Spear which pierced our Saviour's ſide. And ſo many pieces of the Croſs were found in ſeveral Abbies as joined toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther would have made a large Croſs. The Rood of
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:57822:72"/>
Grace at Boxley in Kent which had drawn ſo many Pilgrims to it, was brought to St. Paul's Croſs, which by many ſprings uſed to bow down and lift up it ſelf, to rowl the Eyes, ſhake the Head, Hands, and Feet, move the Lips, ſeem pleaſed, or angry, by bending the Brows, which the credulous multitude imputed to a Divine Power, but was now made appear to be a Cheat, and the Springs openly ſhewed that governed its ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral motions. Likewiſe the Images of our Lady of Walſingham and Ipſwich, adorned with rich Jewels, and divers others both in England and Wales were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved out of the Churches, and being brought to London were openly burnt in the preſence of the Lord Cromwell at Chelſey. The blood of Chriſt was ſhewed in a Glaſs Vial at Hales in Gloceſterſhire, and the Prieſts ſaid it was not viſible to any that were in Mortal Sin. So that after the People had well paid, it became viſible to them, and the deluded Souls went away well ſatisfied that they were now free from any damnable tranſgreſſion. But this was proved to be the Blood of a Duck renewed every Week, and put into a Glaſs thick on one ſide and thin on the other, ſo that till the Pilgrim had offered what the Prieſt thought fit, the dark ſide was turned to him, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward the light ſide. Several ſuch Impoſtures were diſcovered, which tended much to undeceive the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. But the richeſt Shrine in England was that of St. Thomas of Becket that great Rebel to King Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry II. and for whoſe death he ſeverely whipt himſelf a great way to the Cathedral of Canterbury, where he was killed by four of King Henry's officious Servants, and he thereupon Canonized a Saint, to whoſe Altar greater Oblations were made than to that of our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour or the Virgin Mary. Every fiftieth year there was a Jubilee and an Indulgence, granted to all that came and viſited his Tomb, who were ſometimes thought to be an hundred thouſand on that occaſion, he prints of their kneeling and devotion remaining in the Stones to this day. So that it was immenſly Rich
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:57822:73"/>
with Gold, Jewels, Plate and Money, the Gold only being ſo heavy that it filled two Cheſts, which requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red eight men a piece to carry them out of the Church. The Timber work of this Shrine was covered with Plates of Gold, Damaſked and Imboſſed with VVires of Gold, garniſhed with Images, Angels, great Orient Pearls and Precious Stones, the chief whereof was a rich Jewel offered by Lewes ſeventh of France who came over in Pilgrimage to viſit this Tomb, and to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain that for the future no Paſſenger ſhould be drown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed betwixt Dover and Callice. It was valued to be the richeſt Jewel in Europe. St. Thomas's Skull which had been ſo much VVorſhipped was proved an Impoſture, for the true Skull was with the reſt of his Bones in the Coffin, and were now ſo mixt with other Bones that it had been a Miracle indeed to have diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſht them afterwards. Then the Axes and Hammers went to work in pulling down the Neſts of Superſtition and Idolatry, whoſe number as Camden reckons them were ſix hundred forty five Monaſteries, ninty Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leges, an hundred and ten Hoſpitals, and two thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand three hundred ſeventy four Chauntries and free Chappels, and their Lands and Revenues being by Act of Parliament ſettled on the Crown, the King by the advice of the Lord Cromwell politickly exchanged them for others with his Nobility and Gentry, allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them good Bargains for their Incouragement, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of whoſe Eſtates do now conſiſt wholly of Poſſeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of this nature, or elſe were greatly inlarged by them, and the reſtoration of them to their former uſes was thereby rendred ſo impracticable, that all the flaming zeal of Queen Mary for Popery was never able to effect any thing of that kind. And this may be thought to have been one ſtrong Barrier and Security of this Nation againſt Popiſh Slavery to this very day, notwithſtanding the many attempts that have ſince been made to reduce us back to that Houſe of bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage.</p>
            <p>The Churches being thus cleanſed from rubbiſh,
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:57822:73"/>
the magnanimous Lord Cromwell reſolved to place better Ornaments in them, and therefore he ſent out Injunctions requiring the Clergy to ſet up Engliſh Bibles in their Churches, and to incourage all to read them. Exhorting the People not to diſpute about the ſenſe of difficult places but to leave that to better Judgments. Miniſters were likewiſe commanded to inſtruct the People and to teach them the Creed, the Lord's Prayer, and the Ten Commandments in Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh, and that once every Quarter, there ſhould be a Sermon to declare the true Goſpel of Chriſt, and to exhort the People to works of Charity, and not to truſt to other mens Works, to Pilgrimages, or Relicks, or telling their Beads, which was only Superſtition. Alſo the folly of offering Candles to Images, and that to make any uſe of Images in Divine Worſhip was Idolatry, and the praying to Saints unneceſſary. Theſe ſtruck at ſome of the main Points of the former Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtition, but the free uſe of the Scriptures gave the deadlieſt blow of all. Yet all the Clergy ſubmitted to them without murmuring.</p>
            <p>The Death of Queen Ann Bullen (who was behead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſome time before for ſeveral pretended Crimes, which ſhe utterly denied at the Scaffold, and of which a great number of worthy men thought her Innocent) gave freſh hopes to the Popiſh Clergy that a ſtop would have been put to any further Reformation, of which ſhe was reckoned a great promoter and incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rager. And the Succeſſion of the Crown being likewiſe altered by Parliament: By whom Queen Mary was declared Illegitimate as born of Queen Katherine in unlawful Marriage, and a new Oath impoſed upon all the People to acknowledge the Children of the Queen Ann to be rightful Heirs to the Crown, and ſhe leaving one Daughter (who was afterward the renowned Queen Elizabeth) that Party had likewiſe expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions that ſhe being dead, the Lady Mary would ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed to the Crown, to which end ſhe was perſuaded to ſubmit her ſelf to the King, and own him as Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pream
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:57822:74"/>
Head of the Church of England, which ſhe had hitherto refuſed. But within twenty days after this Tragedy was over, the King Married the Lady Jane Seymour Daughter of Sr. John Seymour, by whom he had the moſt excellent Prince Edward, who ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded him, though within few days after the good Queen died. The birth of a Son blaſted the Papiſts expectations, and therefore Gardiner, Bonner and the reſt of that Clergy ſeemed now very zealous in promoting the Injunctions that Cromwell had lately publiſhed. Yet Gardiner ſtill retaining a ſecret hatred againſt the Reformation, he by his Artifices and Flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teries prevailed much with the King, perſuading him that his zeal againſt Hereſie was the greateſt advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage that his Cauſe, in renouncing the Pope could have over all Europe. Which meeting with the King's own perſuaſion of the Corporal preſence of Chriſt in the Sacrament, cauſed him to ſit in Perſon upon the Trial of one John Lambert a learned man, who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he would not recant his opinion about Tranſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantion was cruelly burnt in Smithfield, and in the next Parliament an Act was made for making it death not to conſent to the ſix Articles following (which were after called the ſix bloody Articles.) I. That after the words of Conſecration; the Real and Natural Body and Blood of Chriſt was in the Sacrament. II. That Communion in both kinds was not neceſſary to Salvation. III. That Prieſts by the Laws of God ought not to Marry. IV. That Vows of Chaſtity are to be obſerved. V. That private Maſſies were agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to the Word of God. VI. That Auricular Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion was neceſſary to be retained. Againſt moſt of theſe Cranmer argued ſeveral days, and Cromwell promoted Bonner to the Biſhoprick of Hereford to be a faithful ſecond to Cranmer in his Pious deſigns, though he afterward proved a violent Perſecutor, and indeed Cranmer wanted ſupport againſt the other Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops, who made great complaints of the raſhneſs of the Proteſtant Preachers who were very furious againſt
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:57822:74"/>
ſome things not yet aboliſhed. Upon which, Letters were writ to the Biſhops to take care that as the People ſhould be rightly inſtructed, ſo they ſhould not be of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended with too many Novelties. Thus was Cran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer's intereſt ſo low that he had none but Cromwell to depend on. There was not a Queen now in the King's Boſom to ſupport them; and the refuſal of own<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing theſe Articles cauſed the death of many Proteſtants, as the denying the King's Supremacy cut off ſeveral Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſt, ſo that at the ſame time Proteſtants were burnt on one ſide Smithfield, and Papiſts hanged on the other, which made Forreigners admire, as not underſtanding what Religion King Henry was of.</p>
            <p>Hereupon Cromwell contrived how the King ſhould be ingaged in a nearer Alliance with the Proteſtant Princes of Germany; with whom he had already ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led a League, and who was acknowledged its Patron, he ſending over an hundred thouſand Crowns a year for the ſupport of it; all ingaging, That they would join againſt the Pope as the Common Enemy, and ſet up the true Religion according to the Goſpel. Now that the King might be prevailed upon both, by Affection and Intereſt, to carry on what he had thus begun, Cromwell reſolved to bring about a Match be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the King and the Lady Ann Siſter to William Duke of Cleve, whoſe other Siſter Frederick Duke of Saxony, a very zealous Proteſtant, had eſpouſed. And the King unwilling to live any longer a Wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dower, both the Emperor and the King of France propoſed Matches to him, but Reaſons of State in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined him powerfully to that with the Lady Ann. Her Father had before Treated with the Prince of Lorrain about Marrying her, but it went no farther than a Contract between the two Fathers. And the famous Painter Hans Holbin much favoured her in the Picture which was ſent to the King, who never liked the Original ſo well as he did that. The Duke of Saxe diſſuaded the Match becauſe the King was going backward in the Reformation as appear'd by his enact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:57822:75"/>
the ſix bloody Articles, but Cromwell carried it on with the greateſt vigor. Some write that the Lady was handſome enough, but could ſpeak only Dutch which the King underſtood not, neither had ſhe learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Muſick, and was alſo ſo ſtiff in her Carriage as no way ſuited the King's temper. However the Marriage was concluded, and arriving at Rocheſter the King was ſo impatient to ſee her that he went thither incog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nito, but was much dampt at firſt ſight, for he thought her demeanour ſo rude that he aſkt whether they had brought over a Flanders Mare to him, and thencefor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward had an abſolute averſion for her Perſon: Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther had he any kindneſs for her Religion, and many Virtues, ſhe being a very Devout Proteſtant. So that he reſolved to break the Match if poſſible; but for fear of diſobliging the German Princes, his affairs making their friendſhip very neceſſary to him at this time, to obviate the deſigns of the Emperor, Pope and French King now projecting againſt him, he Married her but expreſt his diſlike of her ſo plainly, that all about him took notice of it, and the day after he told Cromwell that he had not conſummated his Marriage with her, and did believe he ſhould never do it, complaining of ill ſmells about her, and that he ſuſpected ſhe was not a Virgin, which ſo much increaſed his diſlikes, that he thought he ſhould be never able to endure her. Crom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well endeavoured in vain to overcome theſe prejudices, ſo that though the King lived with her five Months, and lay often in the Bed with her, yet was his aver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion rather increaſed than abated.</p>
            <p>About this time all the ground that the Reformation gained after ſo much had been lately loſt, was a liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty for all private perſons to have Bibles in their Houſes the managing of which was put into Cromwell's hands by a particular Patent. And a new Parliament being called, as the Lord Chancellor declared the matters of State to them, ſo the Vicegerent Cromwell ſpake to them concerning Religion, telling them, <q rend="margSglQuotes">'That the King deſired nothing ſo much as an entire Union among all
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:57822:75"/>
his Subjects, but that ſome Incendiaries oppoſed it as much as he promoted it, and that raſhneſs on one ſide, and inveterate Superſtition on the other, had raiſed great diſſentions, which were inflamed by the reproachful names of Papiſt and Heretick, and though they had now the Word of God in all their hands, yet they rather ſtudied to juſtifie their Paſſions, than amend and govern their Lives by it. To re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move which, the King had appointed ſeveral Biſhops to ſettle the Doctrine and Ceremonies, and to pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh an expoſition of the Doctrine of Chriſt without corrupt mixtures, and yet to retain ſuch Ceremonies as ſhould be thought neceſſary, reſolving afterward to puniſh all Tranſgreſſors of either ſide.</q> At this time Cromwell was created Earl of Eſſex, which ſh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ws that the King's diſlike of the Queen was not the chief cauſe of his ruin, otherwiſe he had not now advanced him.</p>
            <p>The Popiſh Biſhops (eſpecially Gardiner) being glad to be any way rid of a Proteſtant Queen, heightned the King's averſion to the Lady Ann of Cleve by all means poſſible, and perſuaded the King to move for a Divorce. The Queen ſeem'd little concerned at it, and expreſt much willingneſs to diſcharge him from a Marriage ſo unacceptable to him. The Lords addreſt to him that he would ſuffer the Marriage to be exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, which being granted, a Commiſſion was ſent to the Convocation to diſcuſs it, and Witneſſes being heard, it appeared that her Pre-contract with the Prince of Lorrain was not fully cleared. And that the King had Married her againſt his Will. And not having given an inward and compleat conſent, he had never conſummated the Marriage, ſo that no Iſſue could be expected from the Queen. Whereupon the Convo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation publiſht an authentick Inſtrument under the Seals of the two Archbiſhops, declaring to the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian World that the King's Marriage with the Lady Ann of Cleve was a nullity, void, fruſtrate and of none effect, becauſe the ſaid Lady under her own hand had
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:57822:76"/>
upon due examination confeſt that the King never had, nor could perform to her that Benevolence which by a Huſband was due to a Wife. This Sentence was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed by Parliament, adding that it was lawful ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Eccleſiaſtical Laws, for the King to Marry another Wife, and for the Lady Ann of Cleve to take another Huſband according to the Laws of Holy Church. And all ſuch as by Writing, Printing or Speaking did maintain the contrary ſhould be puniſht as for High Treaſon.</p>
            <p>During this Tranſaction a ſudden turn happened at Court. The Lord Cromwell was ſuddenly Arreſted for High Treaſon by the Duke of Norfolk in the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil Chamber at White-Hall, and committed Priſoner to the Tower. The lowneſs of his birth procured him many Enemies among the Nobility, to ſee a Black<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſmiths Son prefer'd to ſuch high Dignity, He being at the ſame time Lord Vicegerent, Lord Privy Seal, and Lord High Chamberlain of England, Earl of Eſſex, and Maſter of the Rolls. The Popiſh Clergy hated him mortally, the ſuppreſſion of the Abbies, and the Injunctions about Reformation in the Church, being imputed to his Counſels: And the King being freed from the fear of the Confederacy betwixt the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror and French King againſt him, who could not agree upon the Terms; Cromwells Counſel's now became uſeleſs to him, and he hoped the making him a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice might ſomewhat appeaſe the People, who were much diſturbed at ſome late proceedings. And ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, he now intended a Match with Katherine Howard Neice to the Duke of Norfolk a Papiſt and an Enemy to the Reformation. The King was likewiſe told that Cromwell was an Enemy to the Six Articles, and incouraged thoſe that oppoſed them.</p>
            <p>Of the truth of the faſt we read this following Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage. About two years before, the King ordered Archbiſhop Cranmer to put in Writing all the Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments he had uſed in Parliament againſt the ſix Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles: He likewiſe ſent Cromwell and the Duke of
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:57822:76"/>
Norfolk to Dine with him, and aſſure him of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance of his favour and kindneſs to him. At Table they acknowledged that Cranmer had oppoſed the Articles with much Prudence and Learning, expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing a great value for him, and telling him that thoſe who differed from his opinion could not but eſteem him highly for his worth, and ſince the King ſeemed to approve of them, he need fear nothing. Cromwell added, That the King had ſo much reſpect for him above his other Counſellors, that he would not give ear to any complaints againſt him, and that as Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Woolſey loſt his friends by Pride, the other gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon his Enemies by his Humility and Moderation. The Duke of Norfolk replied, he could ſpeak beſt of the Cardinal, having been his man ſo long. Crom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well replied warmly, That he never liked his Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, but ſaid he, If he had been Pope, I never in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to have gone into Italy with him, as you my Lord Duke deſigned to have done. The Duke ſwore he lied and gave him ill Language which put all the company into diſorder, and they were never friends afterward. Cranmer drew up his Reaſons againſt the ſix Articles, and gave them to his Secretary to tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe fairly for the King's uſe, but croſſing the Thames, met with a very odd accident. For a Bear being bait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed near the River broke looſe, and running into the Water overturned the Boat wherein the Secretary was, whereby his Book fell into the Thames, and was taken up by the Bearward, who ſhewed it to a Prieſt; he preſently perceived it was a Refutation of the ſix Articles, and told the Bearward that the Author would certainly be hanged. The Secretary coming to demand his Book, which he ſaid was the Archbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops, and offering him a Crown to Drink for ſaving it: The Fellow being an obſtinate Papiſt, replied, he would not part with it for five hundred Crowns. The Secretary acquainting Cromwell with the matter, he ſent for the Bearward, who gueſſing at the buſineſs brought the Book with intent to have delivered it to
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:57822:77"/>
Stephen Gardiner or Sir Anthony Brown, both inve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terate Enemies to Proteſtancy. Cromwell ſeeing him, ſnatcht the Book from him, and giving it to the Secre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary, Here, ſays he, I know this is your hand, take it with you, and Sirrah, ſays he to the Fellow, you de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve to be puniſht for detaining a Privy Counſellor's Book when demanded, you being fitter to meddle with Bears than matters of State. And ſo Cranmer was preſerved from the danger of Fire, which at this time threatned him by Water.</p>
            <p>The blow at Cromwel was ſuddenly given, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in diſgrace, he had the common Lot of diſcarded Favourites, to be forſaken by his Friends, and inſul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted over by his Enemies, of whom Gardiner was the moſt implacable; only Cranmer ſtuck to him, and in a Letter to the King on his behalf, he aſſured him, He had always found that the Lord Cromwel ever loved his Majeſty above all things; and that he had ſerved him with ſuch Fidelity and Succeſs, that he was of the Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, no King of England had ever a more faithful Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter, wiſhing the King might find a Councellor, who was as willing and able to do him Service as he was: But the King being freed from his Marriage, and hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing made Katherine Howard his Queen in a few Weeks after, the Duke of Norfolk had now an opportunity to be revenged on him, ſhe being Daughter to the Lord Edmund Howard, Brother to the Duke: So that from henceforth, the King looked diſcontentedly upon his former intimate Favourite and inward Counſellor, as being told that he was the cauſe of all his late Troubles.</p>
            <p>Thoſe who had long deſired his Downfal, ſoon per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving this Alteration, drew up a long Bill of Attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der againſt him in the Houſe of Lords, which was read twice in one day; and ſent to the Commons, who af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ten days debate paſſed it, whereby he was condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned for High Treaſon and Hereſie, by that unjuſt way of Attainder without coming to an Anſwer; wherein it was ſet forth, That though the King had raiſed him from a low Eſtate to high Dignities, yet it appeared by
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:57822:77"/>
many Witneſſes, that were Perſons of Honour, that he was the moſt corrupt Traytor that ever was known; That joining with the laſt Queen Ann, he had favoured the Lutherans above meaſure, and ſo ſtrongly ſuppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted them againſt the Catholick Prelates and Prieſts of this Kingdom, that when he was told by ſome of the Clergy, that they doubted not but the King would ſhortly curb their Boldneſs and Preſumption, the ſaid Lord Cromwel did reply, That he was ſure of the King; and that about two Years before, he had ſaid, the Preaching of Barnes and other Hereticks was good, and that he would not turn, though the King did turn, but if the King turned, he would fight in Perſon againſt him, and all that turned; and drawing out his Dagger, he wiſht he might be pierced to the Heart with it, if he did not do it: And that if he lived a Year or two long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er it ſhould not be in the King's Power to hinder it. That he had ſet many at liberty who were condemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed or ſuſpected of Miſpriſion of Treaſon. That he had given Licenſes for Tranſporting out of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom things prohibited by Proclamation, had granted Paſports without ſearching, and had diſperſed many erroneous Books contrary to the belief of the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. And had ſaid, that every man might adminiſter it as well as the Prieſt. That he had Licenſed ſeveral Preachers ſuſpected of Hereſie, and had diſcharged many that were committed on that account. That he had many Hereticks about him and had diſcouraged Informers. He was likewiſe charged with Bribery and Oppreſſion, and that when he heard ſome Lords were conſulting about him, he threatned that he would raiſe great diſturbances in England.</p>
            <p>Many of theſe things were charged upon him in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral, but no particulars produced: And the words about the King being ſworn to have been ſpoken two years before, it was ſtrange that they ſhould be ſo long concealed, conſidering the powerful Adverſaries which he had. As to the Licenſes, it was thought he had the King's Order for what he did in it. Bribery

and Oppreſſion ſeem to be added only to render him odious, who always appeared of a quite contrary tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per. And therefore Authors think that the chief cauſe of the King's Indignation was, that having diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered his affection for the Lady Katherine Howard to him, Cromwell uſed ſome words in defence of Queen Ann of Cleve, and in diſlike of the Lady Kathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rine, which ſo much diſpleaſed the King, that he thereupon delivered him up into the hands of his Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies who thirſted for his Blood, and fearing that he would clear himſelf from all their Calumnies by a Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal Trial, they Tried, Judged and Condemned him by a way which ſeems both againſt Nature and Reaſon, and Juſtice, not being ſuffered to appear, or ſpeak a word in his own defence.</p>
            <p>When he was Priſoner in the Tower, ſeveral Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioners were ſent thither to examine him, who found him in a very compoſed ſedate frame, bearing his affliction with a Patient and Chriſtian Conſtancy of Mind, not at all ruffled with the ſuddenneſs of his Fall, for he foreſaw the Tempeſt before it came, and prepared for the ſame. And being ſenſible of the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gilance power and malice of his adverſaries, he called his Servants before him, and told them that he found himſelf upon a very uncertain foundation, and that a ſtorm was approaching, and therefore charged them that they ſhould manage all their affairs with Upright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Juſtice, that ſo he might not be blamed, or ſuffer by any miſdemeanors of theirs. He entertained the Commiſſioners with much gravity and freedom, and anſwered all their Interrogatories with great mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration and diſcretion, being as well informed in all matters Eccleſiaſtical or Civil as themſelves. He once deſired one of theſe Commiſſioners (ſuppoſed to be Stephen Gardiner his moſt implacable Enemy) to carry a Letter from him to the King, who replied, That he would carry no Letter to the King from a Traytor. Then ſaid the Lord Cromwell, Pray deliver a Meſſage to him by word of Mouth. This he conſented to, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:57822:78"/>
it were not againſt his Allegiance; <q rend="margSglQuotes">'Well my Lords, ſaid he to the reſt, pray be witneſſes of what this Lord hath promiſed: Pray then preſent my duty to the King, and tell him, That when he hath tried and proved you ſo throughly as I have done, he will find you the falſeſt man that ever he had about him.</q> Before this he writ a Letter to the King which none durſt undertake to deliver him, but Mr. Sadler his old friend, willing to do him a kindneſs, firſt went to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand the King's pleaſure whether he would per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit him to do it, which the King granting, he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented the Letter to him, who commanded him to read it to him thrice over, ſeeming much affected with it.

            </p>
            <p>After this he quietly laid down his Head on the Block, which was cut off at three or four ſtrokes by the hand of an unskilful and butcherly Executioner. Thus fell this Magnanimous Worthy, who roſe meerly by the ſtrength of his natural Parts, for his education was ſuitable to his mean extraction. He carried his greatneſs with extraordinary moderation, and his zeal for the Reformation created him many potent adverſaries, who continually ſought for matter againſt him, till in the end by lies, falſhood, and flattery they had thrown him out of the King's favour. He mixed none of the Superſtitions of the Church of Rome in his Devotions at his Death, and uſed the word Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Faith to expreſs the antient Apoſtolick Doctrine,
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:57822:80"/>
of Chriſt, in oppoſition to Popiſh Novelties. With him fell the Office of Vicegerent, and none ſince ever had that Character. The miſeries that befell the new Queen Katherine, and the Duke of Norfolk and his Family were thought to be the Judgments of Heaven upon them for their cruel proſecuting this Unfortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate Favourite. The Queen being in a few months be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>headed for her former lewd Life, together with the Lady Rochford her Bawd (as the Act of Parliament called her) who had been very inſtrumental in the ruin of Queen Ann Bullen, and of her own Huſband the Lord Rochford, who being now diſcovered to be ſo vile a Woman, it tended much to raiſe both their reputations again. The Duke of Norfolk and his Son the Earl of Surrey were both condemned for High Treaſon a few years after, and the Son was beheaded, the Father happily eſcaping by the death of King Henry.</p>
            <p>To conclude, The Lord Cromwell had ſeveral emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent Virtues ſo conſpicuous in him, that they ought not to be concealed. His gratitude eminently appeared toward one Freſcobald an Italian Merchant, who had relieved him in his neceſſities in that Country, which he rewarded afterward with ſo exceſſive a generoſity as ſeveral eminent Pens have ſtrove who ſhould the moſt celebrate the ſame, and of which I have given a particular relation in a Book called <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nparallell'd Varie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, or the Tranſcendent effects of Gratitude,</hi> &amp;c. of the like value with this. His Charity was very apparent, in that foreſeeing himſelf declining in the King's fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, he like a kind and loving Maſter provided be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forehand for almoſt all his Servants, and gave twelve Children of his Muſick twenty pound apiece: And likewiſe in delivering many out of danger for having broken Popiſh Laws and Conſtitutions. His Humility was very eminent in ſeveral inſtances, particularly that He and Archbiſhop Cranmer riding once in ſtate through Cheapſide, Cromwell ſeeing a poor Woman to whom he had formerly owed Money, called her to
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:57822:80"/>
him, and bid her go to his Houſe, where he not only diſcharged the Debt, but ſetled a Penſion of four pound a year upon her during Life. At another time obſerving a poor man at the Court of Sherin imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in Sweeping the Cloyſters and Ringing the Chappel Bell, He in the Company of ſeveral Lords called him by his name, and ſaid, This poor mans Father was a great friend to me, having given me many a meals meat in my neceſſity, and therefore I am reſolved to provide for him as long as I live, which he did accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly. His Wiſdom and Policy in ſtate affairs was very obvious in the management of all Treaties, Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotiations, and Tranſactions, both at home and abroad with the utmoſt prudence, dextegity and ſucceſs. Laſtly and Principally, his fervent zeal for the true Religion was ſufficiently diſcovered by the Injunctions, Proclamations and Articles, publiſhed by his advice, for promoting and advancing the ſame. In a word, many Ages before and ſince, have not been bleſt with two ſuch excellent Perſons as the Lord Cromwell, and Archbiſhop Cranmer, who both flouriſht toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther at this time.</p>

            <p>BY the fall of this Great Man we may obſerve that the Love of a People may be of no leſs dangerous conſequence to a Subject to truſt to, than their hatred proves ſatal to ſuch Princes as are ſo unwary to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe it. Nor is the affection of a Prince to a Favou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite to be much relied on, ſince their love is often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times inconſtant, and their anger deadly. Of both
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:57822:81"/>
which we can ſcarce find a more pregnant inſtance than in the Life and Death of this Eminent Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourite.</p>
            <p>Robert Devereux was born in 1566. and was not above ten years of Age when his Father Walter Earl of Eſſex, and Earl Marſhal of Ireland deceaſed at Dublin, Premoniſhing his Son never to forget the thirty ſixth year of his Age, as the utmoſt term of Life, which neither himſelf nor his Father before him ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vived, and which his Son never attained to. After his Father's death he was under the Tuition of the Pious and Learned Dr. Whitgift, and at ſixteen years performed his publick Acts as Maſter of Arts. His firſt advancement at Court was procured by the Earl of Leiceſter his Father in Law, and was thought to be deſigned not ſo much out of love to him, as envy againſt Sr. Walter Rawleigh. His Deſcent was very honourable, his Title being derived from Evereux a City in Normandy. His Title of Lord came by Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage with Cicily the Daughter of William Bourchier whoſe Grandmother was Siſter to Edward IV. King of England, whoſe great Grandmother was Daughter to Thomas of Woodſtock Son of King Edward III. born of one of the Daughters of Humfry Bohun Earl of Hartford and Eſſex, whereupon the Title of Viſcount Hartford was beſtowed upon his great Grandfather Walter, by King Edward VI. and that of Earl of Eſſex upon his Father by Q Elizabeth. So that this high Birth might fill him with ſome ambitious thoughts. He was with much ado at firſt made Maſter of the Horſe, the Queen being diſpleaſed with his Mother, but afterward when by his obſervance and duty he had procured her full favour, ſhe forgave a great debt that his Father owed her, made him a Knight of the Garter and a Privy Counſellor when he was ſcarce twenty three years old. His firſt appearance in action was at Tilbury Camp in 1588. being made by the Queen, General of the Horſe, to whom in the fight of the Souldiery and People ſhe diſcovered a more than ordinary kindneſs.</p>
            <pb n="157" facs="tcp:57822:81"/>
            <p>And now Queen Elizabeth to follow the blow that ſhe had given the Spaniſh Armada, the next year ſends Sir Francis Drake and Sir John Norris with a Fleet, and ſome Forces to the aid of Don Antonio, who pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended a Right to the Crown of Portugal; but Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lip II. of Spain being both ambitious and powerful, ſent the Duke of Alva with an Army thither, who drove this new King out of his Country, and after many ſkirmiſhes wholly poſſeſſed himſelf of that Kingdom for his Maſter. The Engliſh Forces landed near the Groin in Gallicia and took the lower Town. During this Voyage the Earl of Eſſex unwilling to be idle, when honour was to be gotten, went privately to Sea without the Queen's knowledge or conſent, and joined the Fleet: At which ſhe was much diſturbed, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, This young Fellow is ſo ventrous that he will cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly be knockt on the Head one time or other. The Engliſh likewiſe took Peniche another Town in Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tugal, and approached Liſbon, took the Caſtle of Caſcays, burnt the Town of Vigo, and finding that the Portugueſe did not declare for Don Antonio as he expected, ſickneſs likewiſe increaſing among the Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers, the Fleet returned home.</p>
            <p>After this the Popiſh Princes of France entring into a League that they would have no Proteſtant reign over them, raiſed an Army againſt the King of Navar their rightful Soveraign, who thereupon craved aid of the Q. who readily aſſiſted him with money, and then with men under the Earl of Eſſex, who gave ſufficient proof of his Valour upon all occaſions, his Brother Walter being ſlain before the Walls of Roan. Upon which the Earl challenged Villars the Governor of the City to a ſingle Combat, which he durſt not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept of. The Earl a while after returned to England, being informed by his friends that many envious Cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiers were contriving to throw him out of the Queen's favour.</p>
            <p>In 1595. Arch-Duke Albert Governor of the Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh Netherlands for the King of Spain, ſuddenly Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieged
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:57822:82"/>
Callice and took it, the news whereof ſo ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prized the Queen becauſe of the near Neighbourhood of this Potent Enemy, that to divert the Tempeſt from England, She and the States of Holland inſtant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſet out a Navy of 140 Ships, whereon were imbar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qued about ſeven thouſand Souldiers and as many Seamen, commanded in chief by the Earl of Eſſex and Charles Howard joint Admirals, with ſeveral other Inferior Commanders of great Courage and Conduct, who Sailing to Cadiz, in a ſhort time took both the Town and Caſtle, no man of Note being loſt in this Expedition but Captain Wingfield; and after having Ranſackt the Town and Iſland whereon it is built, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moliſht the Forts, burnt moſt of the Houſes, filled their Ships with Plunder, and burnt ſeveral Spaniſh Veſſels, the Fleet returned victoriouſly home. The King of Spain having loſt in this Gallant Expedition, thirteen of his beſt men of War, forty Merchants Ships from New Spain, an hundred Cannon, with ſuch vaſt Stores of Ammunition and Naval Proviſions, that he was not able to fit out another Fleet for many years after; and the Spaniards themſelves gave this Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter of the brave Engliſh; That they were Hereticks in Religion, but in all other affairs Warlike, Poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick, and truly Noble. This happy Succeſs advanced Eſſex in the opinion both of the Queen, Souldiery and Common People, though his making ſo many Knights ſome of them of very mean fortunes produced this Libel.

            </p>
            <p>The Queens indulgence increaſing by this fortunate Expedition, he grew wanton with her favours, and was offended if ſhe prefer'd any but thoſe recommend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by himſelf, as particularly Sir Francis Vere being
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:57822:82"/>
made Governour of Brill in Holland, and Sir Robert Cecil Secretary of State, both which he had deſigned for other Perſons, he diſcovered ſo ſevere a reſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for it, that his Enemies and Enviers turn'd it at length to his diſadvantage. After this, Eſſex is made Admiral of a Fleet, that were ſent againſt the Iſlands of Azores belonging to the Spaniard, where the Iſland of Gracioſa and Faial yielded to him, and like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe Villa Franca. And then returning, Eſſex who would be ſole Favourite, had great contentions with Sir Walter Rawleigh and Cecil, &amp;c. and likewiſe with Charles Howard who was now made Earl of Notting<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham, becauſe the Queen had given him part of the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of the Victory at Cales. However the Queen's affections ſo blinded her that ſhe paſſed by many In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignities, offered her by him, and to pacifie him crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted him Earl Marſhal of England.</p>
            <p>In 1598. Some Propoſals being offered for conclud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a Peace with Spain the Earl of Eſſex oppoſed it, urging the Spaniſh Ambition for gaining the Univerſal Monarchy, his inveterate hatred againſt the Queen and the Kingdom, his Maxim, That no Faith is to be kept with Hereticks, and that the Pope could diſpenſe with him to break all Leagues when for his advantage, theſe and many ſuch cogent Reaſons made a Peace with him impracticable. But other great Courtiers whether for Reaſons of State, or that they had received ſome Spaniſh Gold, were very much diſpleaſed, ſo that the Lord Burleigh told him, That he breathed nothing but War and Slaughter, and turning to the Pſalm he bid Eſſex read that verſe, as ſeeming to preſage his future Fate, <hi>Blood-thirſty men ſhall not live out half their days.</hi> Yet many much admired his Conduct as really deſigning nothing but the honour and ſecurity of his Country. However, the Queen and Eſſex were of a contrary opinion both as to the Peace, and to a fit Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to be ſent Lord Deputy into Ireland. The Queen judged William Knolles the Earl's Uncle proper for the imployment: Eſſex affirmed George Carew to be
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:57822:83"/>
much fitter, and becauſe he could not perſuade the Q. to be of his mind he contemptibly turn'd his back and ſeem'd to ſcoff at her. At which ſhe growing out of patience ſtept forward, and giving him a ſound box on the Ear, bid him be gone with a vengeance. At which he laid his hand upon his Sword, but the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miral coming up to him, he vowed and ſwore, <q rend="margSglQuotes">'That he neither would nor could put up ſo great an Indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, which he would never have taken from her Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther King Henry, much leſs from the hand of a Woman.</q> And then in a great rage he withdrew from Court. Afterward the Lord Keeper ſent him ſeveral Letters, exhorting him to come and aſk the Queen pardon, whom if he had juſtly wronged he could not make her ſatisfaction, and if ſhe had wronged him yet, his Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, Duty, and Religion ſhould oblige him to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit himſelf to ſo good a Queen, ſince there is a great inequality between a Prince and a Subject. Eſſex an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered very haughtily to theſe Advices, and his Fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers publiſhed his uſual expreſſions upon this ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count. As <q rend="margSglQuotes">'That he appealed for Juſtice from the Queen to God Almighty. That no Tempeſt rageth more than the indignation of an Impotent Prince.

Cannot they Injure their Subjects? Is their Earthly power Infinite? 'Tis the Fool, ſays Solomon, that being ſtruck, laughs; They that receive benefit who by the Errors of Princes, let them bear the inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of Princes; Let them believe the Queen's Power In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite believe that God is not Omnipotent; As for my part I being rent in pieces by injuries have long enough endured bitterneſs of Soul for them.</q>

            <pb n="161" facs="tcp:57822:83"/>
            <p>Yet after all, the Queens Paſſion for him ſoon ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted of an eaſie ſubmiſſion, ſo that he was pardoned and reſtored to favour by her who could be angry with him, but could never hate him, and ſoon after made him Lord Deputy of Ireland, (which was then in an ill condition by the Rebellion of the Natives) and impowered him with ſo ample a Commiſſion as was thought to be contrived by his Enemies, on pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe by inflaming his ambition, to procure his ruin, for he had liberty to pardon or puniſh the Iriſh Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bels ſuitable to his own Will: and Power to reward with Lands or Honours all he eſteem'd worthy. Theſe were ſuch Flowers of the Crown as they ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed deſigned by his Enemies to deck that head they meant to Sacrifice to their malice and revenge. Upon his arrival in Ireland the Earl ſpent ſo much time in ſubduing the petty Rebels, while he not only neglect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the chief one Tyrone with whom inſtead of fight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing he Treated, and made a Truce, that the Queen unſatisfied with his dilatory proceedings, firſt reproa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches his Conduct, and then recalls him. Eſſex was much diſcontented, becauſe the Queen in her Letters had chid him for making the Earl of Southampton Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral of the Horſe, and that Cecil his Enemy was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer'd to be Maſter of the Wards in his abſence. So that within a Month after he unexpectedly returned to England, having ſome thoughts to bring ſo great a force with him as to ſecure himſelf from any danger, but was diſſuaded therefrom by the Earl of Southamp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton and Sir Chriſtopher Blunt. So that only accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied with ſix, he comes to the Court at Nonſuch to inform the Queen of the affairs of Ireland. In the way he met the Lord Grey of Willon his chief Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary, whom one of his Attendants offered to kill to prevent him from doing further miſchief, but the Earl declaring his abhorrence of ſuch wickedneſs haſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to Court and fell upon <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

But ſtill the People had hopes of his Liberty and Reſtora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, becauſe of the extream favour the Queen had for him, who expreſly commanded the Commiſſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners not to deprive him of being Maſter of the Horſe, as if ſhe intended again to uſe his Service. The Earl ſtill expreſt great humility of mind, declaring both by Words and Letters, That he had taken leave of the World, that he had waſht away with his tears the heat of Ambition which was formerly in his Heart, and that he deſired nothing more but that her Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty would let her Servant depart in Peace. The Queen was ſo delighted to hear of theſe expreſſions, that ſhe inſtantly diſcharged him from all confinement ſending him word, That he was now his own man, and admoniſhing him to make his own diſcretion his Keeper, but not to come near her Perſon or Court. The Earl returned anſwer, <q rend="margSglQuotes">'That he humbly kiſt the hand and rod of the Queen which only corrected but not overthrew him, But that he was ſure he ſhould never live a happy day til he ſaw thoſe bleſſed Eyes of hers, which had hitherto been his Stars whereby he had fail'd on happily, and had kept on in a direct courſe. That now he reſolved to repent in earneſt and to ſay with Nebuchadnezzar: My habitation ſhall be amongſt the wild Beaſts of the Field, that I may eat Hay like an O<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            </p>

That they who intend to tame a Wild Horſe muſt keep him without food, That the more a corrupted and diſeaſed body is fed the more hurt it does. The Earl extreamly diſcontented at her anſwer and denial, and that ſhe had beſtowed the Farm upon others, began to hearken to the inſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuations of one Henry Cuffe, Sir Chriſtopher Blount, and Merrick his Steward, who charged him with Puſillanimity and Cowardice for making ſuch mean ſubmiſſions, telling him that the Queen, the Council, and his cruel Enemies had conſpired to make him a Beggar, ſo that he muſt hereafter live on the Alms<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſket, and the crums that fell from their Tables. That ſo being poor, neglected of the Queen, and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaken of his Friends, he might become a ſcorn to his triumphant adverſaries. So they adviſed him that the only remedy againſt all theſe diſaſters was to make his own way to the Queen, he having many of the Nobi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, Gentry and Common People that would ſtand by him and his Cauſe. Theſe ſuggeſtions pierced his Soul daily, ſo that at length he gave himſelf up wholly to their directions, and entertained great numbers of Souldiers and other diſcontented and indigent People, keeping open Houſe to which there was extraordinary reſort; Of which the Queen having notice ſent the Lord Keeper and others to know the meaning of it, who coming thither found the Earls of Eſſex, Rut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, and Southampton among a confuſed number of People in the Yard. The Lord Keeper told the Earls, That the Queen deſired to know the deſign of this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, promiſing that if any injury had been done him he ſhould be righted both in Law and Equity. The Earl anſwered aloud, That wait had been laid for his Life, and that ſome had been hired to Murther him
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:57822:85"/>
in his bed, That he had been Traiterouſly dealt with, and that his Letters had been Counterfeited both with his Hand and Seal. That they were therefore met together to defend themſelves, and to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve their Lives, ſince neither his Patience, nor his Miſeries would appeaſe the Malice of his Adverſaries, unleſs they drank his blood alſo.</p>
            <p>The Lord Keeper then deſired him to give an account of his parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular grievances, but the multitude cried out, <q rend="margSglQuotes">'Let us be gone, come, they abuſe your patience, they betray you my Lord, kill them, kill them, away with the great Seal.

And being zealous alſo to maintain the height of Regal Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty, after the death of Prince <hi>Henry,</hi> he reſolved to match his Son Prince Charles with ſome Princeſs of moſt high Deſcent, though of a different Religion.

And at length Articles were agreed on and ſigned by K. James, whereby the Children of this Marriage were not to be conſtrained to be Proteſtants, nor to loſe their right of ſucceſſion if they were Catholicks. The Pope's Diſpenſation was to be procured, the new Queen was to have Popiſh Chaplains Prieſts, Confeſſors and all other Privileges.

The <hi>K.</hi> was ſatisfied the Ambaſſador was his Enemy, and that ſuch an attempt could never be performed without the conſent of the Prince, whom the Ambaſſador reflect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon, though he did not directly accuſe him, and He thought it ſo horrid and unnatural a deſign, that he paſſed it by without any further notice: But only in ſending to the K. of Spain to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fire juſtice of him againſt his Ambaſſadors falſe Accuſation, which he ſaid wounded his Sons honour through Buck ingham's ſides. Soon after the Ambaſſador was recalled, and for Forms ſake had a little check given him, but was in as much favour as ever.</p>
            <p>Thus was this Information waved, and the Duke ſo far re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſtabliſhed in favour, that he doubted not but to cruſh all that op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed him, and charged Cranfield Earl of Middleſex in Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, with ſeveral miſmanagements of the Revenue, the Prince who was Buckingham's right hand joining with him in it. The King being at New-Market, to free himſelf from the noiſe of bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs, hearing of it, writ to the Prince, <q rend="margSglQuotes">'That he ſhould not take part with any Faction in Parliament againſt the Earl of Middle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſex, but be ſo indifferent that both parties might ſeek to him, for if he bandied to remove old Servants, the time would come that others would do as much by him.</q> This wiſe advice declar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1+ letters">

How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever Cranfield's Actions were proved to be ſo diſhonourable, that he was ſined ſeverely, and made uncapable of ever fitting in the Houſe of Peers for the future.</p>
            <p>Soon after the King died at Theobald's of a Tertian Ague as was then ſaid, and King Charles who in his Fathers Life time was linkt to the Duke, now continued to receive him into an ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mired intimacy and dearneſs, making him Partaker of all his Counſels and Cares, and chief Conductor of his Affairs, an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample rare in this Nation to be the Favourite of two ſucceeding Princes: But was not ſo fortunate as to Parliaments, for though the laſt in King James's time had approved of his Conduct in breaking the Spaniſh Match, yet the firſt Parliament of this King drawing up a Remonſtrance of their Grievances, inveighed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him in their Speeches, as the chief occaſion of all miſcar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riages in Government. As the loſs of the Royalty of the Narrow Seas, by his miſmanagement of the Office of Lord High Admiral; His inriching himſelf and kindred to the impoveriſhing of the King and Crown. His ill beſtowing of Offices of Truſt and Profit. The increaſe of Popery occaſioned by the Dukes Mother and Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in Law, both Papiſts.

And his ſtaying at home (though Admiral) when he ſhould have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded the Fleet, which miſcarried by his being abſent. In the ſame Parliament likewiſe, the Earl of Briſtol accuſed the Duke of High Treaſon, and the Duke charged him with the ſame. One of the Articles againſt Buckingham was, <q rend="margSglQuotes">'That the Pope being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed of his inclination to the Catholick Religion, ſent the Duke a Bull in Parchment, to perſeade and incourage him to pervert the Prince of Wales.</q> After this the Parliament proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to Impeach the Duke upon 13 Articles of High Treaſon and other high Crimes and Miſdemeanors, one of which was his giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Porions and applying Plaiſters to the late King James in his ſickneſs, without the advice and contrary to the directions of his ſworn Phyſicians, from whence proceeded drowths, raving, faint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and an intermitting Pulſe, which <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

After which the Duke gave in an anſwer to all the Articles charged againſt him, as well of miſimploying the Ship

And the Duke acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the King that ſome had reported that this Drink had made him worſe, and that he had given it him without advice, the K. anſwered, They are worſe than Devils that ſay it. However the Parliament proceeded with an Addreſs to the K. for removing the D. from his Council and Preſence, and the Houſe of Lords ſent four Peers to intreat him to give audience to their whole Houſe upon this Subject. But the K. replied, That his reſolution was to hear no motion for that purpoſe, but that he would Diſſolve the Parliament, which he did inſtantly by Commiſſion, which gave occaſion to the People to utter their minds freely upon this Tranſaction.</p>

From whence they marched to St. Martin's, and blockt up the Citadel. But notwithſtanding our Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my at Land and 100 Sail of Ships at Sea, yet the French got into the Harbour with relief of Proviſions; and afterward carried ſo great a ſupply into the Citadel, that the Duke who had lain idle for many VVeeks, being at length prevailed with to Storm it, was forced to retire, and in his retreat had a great number of his Souldiers kill'd and drowned, returning home with great diſuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour. Upon the return of the Fleet, the Cry of the Nation was ſo great, both for the Diſgrace and the Seamen's want of Pay, that the King was obliged to call a Parliamene, which being met, the Duke is declared the Grievance of Grievances, and the Cauſe of all the miſeries of the Kingdom. But the King Proroguing the Parliament before they could proceed againſt him, in the mean time Dr. Lamb the Duke's Creature is murthered in the City out of hatred to his Maſter. And the Town of Rochel (who had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared for the Engliſh when they were there) being now cloſely beſieged by the French. The King had prepared a Fleet under the command of the Duke to relieve it, who being advanced as far as Portſmouth to go aboard, was ſlain by one Lieutenant Felton in his own Lodgings, by one blow with a Knife under the left Rib and up to the Heart, leaving the Knife in his Body, and got away undiſcovered. In his fall to the Ground, the Duke was heard to ſay, The Villain has killed me. Company coming in and finding him weltring in his Blood, began to inquire for the Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therer, when Felton immediately ſtept out and ſaid. <q rend="margSglQuotes">'I am the man that have done the deed, let no man ſuffer that is innocent.</q>
               <pb n="173" facs="tcp:57822:89"/>
VVhen he gave the fatal blow, Felton cry'd, <q rend="margSglQuotes">The Lord have mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy upon thy Soul.</q> VVhich the Duke had not time to pronounce himſelf. Felton had a Paper ſticking to the Lining of his Hat wherein he had written as followeth: <q rend="margSglQuotes">'I would have no man commend me for doing it, but rather diſcommend themſelves, for if God had not taken away their Hearts for their Sins, he had not gone ſo long unpuniſht. The man is cowardly, baſe in mind, opinion, and deſerves not the name of a Gentleman or Souldier, that is unwilling to Sacrifice his Life for the Honour of God, his King, and Country.

            <p>An Ingenious VVriter is much offended with Sir Henry VVot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton, for making a Parallel between the Earl of Eſſex aforemen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned and the Duke of Buckinghim, (to be found in his remains) which he ſays is much to the diſadvantage of Eſſex, who beſides his laſt action, never did any thing ſo ingrateful as might make him fear the anger, or beg the favour of a Parliament, much leſs owe his Life to the Diſſolution of one. He died like a Chriſtian. He was no inſtrument of Tyranny and Oppreſſion, his memory being ſtill valuable among the People. VVhereas the Duke's re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains a contrary Tincture, nor can his bounty to his Friends and Servants expunge his faults, becauſe the Money was drained ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther from the People, the Publick Treaſury, or from the general ſafety of the Nation. Whereas Eſſex obliged his Confidents out of his own ſtore, or by ſuch innocent ways as the Subject had no cauſe to repine at. His natural parts were as great, and his Learning and Birth greater than the Dukes. Nor can his laſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiderate action that rather deſerves the Title of a Riot than Treaſon, come up to ſo great an ingratitude and indignity to the Nation as Buckingham's proceedings at Rochel, wherein the Duke ſhewed no leſs folly in procuring ſo great a hatred among the People, than Eſſex did in miſapplying their love. And if his Picture be exact. Eſſex was as hand ſome as he, which was the chief cauſe of Villers advancement. Only in this Eſſex came ſhort, in having a Miſtreſs that would attend to reaſon, whether it came from friendſhip or malice; Whereas the Dukes fortune depended on two Princes, that in reference to their own weakneſs or his

            <p>THIS great Favourite was born in Chancery Lane London, his Mother coming caſually to the City, but deſcended from an antient Family at Wentworth VVoodhouſe in Yorkſhire. He was educated in St. John's College in Oxford, whereby he was ſo ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſht, that his endowments ſoon advanced him to be a Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of the Houſe of Commons, wherein he appeared very zealous for the Liberties of his Country, and that often with ſo much ſtrength of reaſon, that his Sentiments prevail'd for or againſt the Cauſe he managed. Of which I ſhall give a few inſtances.</p>
            <p>In the Parliament 3. Charles I. Upon a debate on the Grievan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of the Kingdom, by quartering Souldiers, Loans, Benevolence, Privy Seals, and Impriſoning Gentlemen that refuſed to lend Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney on that account, and were refuſed to be Bailed upon there Habeas Corpus, he ſpake thus. <q rend="margSglQuotes">'Surely theſe illegal ways are pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhments and marks of indignation, The raiſing of Loans, ſtrengthned by Commiſſions, with unheard of Inſtructions and Oaths, and the Billetting of Souldiers by Deputy Lieutenants have been ſuch as if they could have perſuaded Chriſtian Princes, that the right of Empires had been to take away mens Proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties by ſtrong hands.

            </p>
            <p>The King hearing of his ability and underſtanding, uſed all means to gain him to himſelf, by beſtowing of Titles of Honour and Places of Truſt upon him, Creating him Viſcount VVent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worth, Earl of Strafford, and Lord Lieutenant of Ireland, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by he made him wholly his own. In Ireland he was very active in augmenting the King's Revenues, and advancing the Royal Authority by all ways within his Power; And upon his return in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to England, he adviſed the King to go into Scotland, and ſettle the Peace of that Kingdom by his Coronation there, he having in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligence that if it were defer'd any longer, the Scots might per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps incline to Elect another King. Upon the troubles that roſe ſoon after there, on the account of impoſing the Common Prayer upon them, and the King reſolving to raiſe an Army to reduce them, but doubting the Parliament would not ſupply him, the Lords told the King that they would ingage their own Credits to forward the buſineſs, and the Earl of Strafford for the incourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſubſcribed 20000<hi>l.</hi> other Noblemen following his example conformable to their Eſtates, and ſome of the Judges contributed largely.</p>
            <p>April 13. 1639, a Parliament being aſſembled, the Earl of Strafford was led into the Houſe of Peers by two Noblemen, to
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:57822:91"/>
give an account of his proceedings in Ireland, having there ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rained the Grant of four Subſides, for maintaing 10000 Foot and 1500 Horſe. Implicitely hinting thereby that they ſhould propoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion their Supplies accordingly. But the Parliament doubting that the Iriſh Forces might indanger Religion, and ſeeming to allow the juſtneſs of the Scots Cauſe, and of the good that might be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained by favouring them in this Conjuncture, the King doubting they might vote againſt the War with the Scots, whom he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved to Treat ſeverely for not complying with his Will and Pleaſure, he thereupon ſuddenly Diſſolves them, to the great diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>content of the People, who for eleven years paſt, durſt ſcarce mention the name of a Parliament.</p>
            <p>Being hereby diſappointed of a ſupply, the King ſends to the Citizens of London to lend Money, and to all Knights and Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men who held Lands of the Crown, to provide Men, Horſes and Arms for his Aſſiſtance. The Citizens generally refuſed, pleading poverty and want of Trade, but by the aſſiſtance of the Gentry, an Army was raiſed with great celerity, of which the Earl of Strafford was made Lieutenant General, and the King command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in Chief. The Scots having notice of theſe preparations, ſpeedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly raiſed an Army, with which they marched into England to make this the Seat of War. The Lord Conway doubting they would take in Newcaſtle, drew off 3000 Foot and about 1200 Horſe to ſecure the Paſs at Newburn. Leſly the Scots General marching forward ſent a Trumpeter to the Lord Conway, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire leave to paſs to the King with their Petition, which being de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied, they fell upon the Engliſh and kill'd 300 of them. Which being accounted an unhappy Omen, ſeveral of the Lords Petition<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the King for a Parliament, which was ſeconded by another from the Scots, and a third from the City of London. At length the King conſented to it, having firſt, by advice of the Peers, conſented to a Treaty with the Scots at Rippon, they refuſing to ſend their Commiſſioners to York, alledging, That the Lieutenant of Ireland reſided there, who proclaimed them Rebels in Ireland, before the King had done it in England, and againſt whom as a chief Incendiary they intended to complain in the next Parliament.</p>
            <p>For the Parliament meeting Nov. 3. 1640. the Scotch Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioners coming to London, had many private Conferences with ſome of the Houſe of Commons, and it was concluded that the Earl of Strafford ſhould be immediately Impeached at his firſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing into the Houſe of Lords, which was done accordingly, and thereupon he was inſtantly taken into Cuſtody, and in March following he was brought to his Trial in Weſtminſter Hall. The King, Queen and Prince were preſent in a private Cloſet, where they could here all, but were ſeen of none.</p>
            <pb n="177" facs="tcp:57822:91"/>
            <p>And then Mr. Pym Impeached the Earl of twenty eight Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles of High Treaſon in the name of the Commons of England, sharging him, That he had Trayterouſly endeavoured to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert the fundamental Laws and Government of England and Ireland, and to introduce an Arbitrary Tyrannical Government, by Trayterouſly aſſuming to himſelf Regal Power over the Laws, Liberties, Perſons, Lands and Goods of his Majeſties Subjects. Had countenanced and encouraged Papiſts: Had maliciouſly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured to ſtir up enmity and hoſtility between the Subjects of England and Scotland. Had wilfully betrayed the King's Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects to death by a diſhonourable retreat at Newburn, that by the effuſion of blood, and the diſhonour and loſs of New-Caſtle, the People of England might be ingaged in a National and Irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concileable quarrel with the Scots. And that to ſecure himſelf from being queſtioned for theſe and other Trayterous Courſes he had laboured to ſubvert the Rights of Parliament, and to incenſe his Majeſty againſt them by falſe and malicious ſlanders, and that upon the Diſſolution of the laſt Parliament, he did treacherouſly and wickedly counſel and adviſe His Majeſty to this effect, That having tryed the affections of his People, he was looſe and abſolv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from all rules of Government, and was to do every thing that power would admit. Since having tried all ways he was refuſed, ſo that he would now be acquitted both by God and Man. And that he had an Army in Ireland (meaning the Army of Papiſts who were his Dependants) which the King might imploy to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce this Kingdom to his obedience. That he falſly, maliciouſly and treacherouſly declared before ſome of the Privy Council, That the Parliament of England had forſaken the King, and that in denying to ſupply him, they had given him the advantage to ſupply himſelf by ſuch ways as he ſhould think fit, and that he was not to ſuffer himſelf to be maſtred by the frowardneſs of the People. That he was very rigorous in levying the illegal Impoſition of Shipmoney, and Impriſoned divers Perſons for not levying the ſame. And a Great Loan of an hundred thouſand pound being demanded of the City, and ſome refuſing to lend, the Lord Mayo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> and Aldermen were required to return their names, which they with humility refuſing to do, the Earl ſaid, That they deſerved to be put to fine and ranſom, and to be made examples, and laid by the heels, and that it would never be well till ſome of the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dermen were hanged up. That by wicked Counſel he had brought on the King exceſſive charges, and then adviſed him to approve of two dangerous Projects. To ſeize the Money in the Mint, and to imbaſe his own Coin with a mixture of Braſs. That he had declared that Ireland was a conquered Nation, and that the King might do with them what he pleaſed, and ſpeaking of the Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of former Kings of England, he ſaid, They were nothing
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:57822:92"/>
worth, and that he would neither have Law nor Lawyers queſtion or diſpute any of his Orders, and that he would make all Ireland know that ſo long as he had the Government there, any Act of State there made, ſhould be as binding to the Subject as an Act of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament. That he did not only Tyrannize over the Bodies but over the Conſciences of Men, by forming and impoſing a new and unuſual Oath, which becauſe ſome Scots refuſed to take, he fined and baniſhed great numbers, and called all that Nation Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bels and Traytors, and ſaid if ever he returned home from Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land he would root them out both ſtock and branch.</p>
            <p>Theſe and a multitude of other crimes, he was charged to have committed both in Ireland and England. Many of which he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt to be true, but not with their aggravations. Some he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied, and others he extenuated, and pleaded that though the whole were proved againſt him, yet it did not amount to Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon. Some of the Lords and Commons were of the ſame opinion. Others urged, That though he were not guilty of any of the Offences declared to be Treaſon by the 25 of Edward III. yet ſo great were his crimes that (according to that Statute which im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>powers the Parliament to declare what is Treaſon) they ought to be declared Treaſon. At length it was concluded to proceed againſt him by way of Attainder, which was much oppoſed like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, it being alleaged, That no man could be convict of Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon but by the Letter of the Statute, and the Lord Digby a Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of the Houſe of Commons, and an earneſt Proſecutor of the Earl ſpake thus of it, <q rend="margSglQuotes">'Mr. Speaker, I am ſtill of the ſame opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion and affections to the Earl Strafford, I confidently believe him the moſt dangerous Miniſter, and the moſt inſupportable to free Subjects that can be found.

I believe him ſtill, the grand Apoſtate to the Common Wealth, who muſt not expect to be pardoned in this World, till he be diſpatcht to the other. I do not ſay but his Crimes may repreſent him a man as worthy to dye, and perhaps worthier than many a Traytor, and may juſtly direct us to enact that they ſhall be Treaſon for the future, but God keep me from giving Judgment of Death on any man, and to ruin his Poſterity upon a Law made after the Crime is committed.</q> And by any Law yet made, I do not believe he is guilty of Treaſon.</p>
            <p>However the Bill of Attainder paſſed in the Houſe of Commons, and Mr. Sir John's endeavoured to ſatisfie the Lords in the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonableneſs thereof, to induce them to Paſs it. For ſaid he, though the proofs at the Trial were inſufficient, and nothing but Legal Evidence can prevail in Judicature, yet by this way both

Lords and Commons might proceed by the light of their own Conſciences, although no evidence were given at all. And after many Aggravations of the Earl's Offences in ſubverting our Laws, as he affirmed, he concluded thus. <q rend="margSglQuotes">'He that would not have had others have any Law, ſhould have none himſelf: It is true, we give Law to Hares and Dee, becauſe they be Beaſts of Chaſe. It was never accounted cruelty or foul play to knock Foxes or Wolves on the Head as they can be found, becauſe theſe be Beaſt of Prey. The Warrenner ſets Traps for Powl-cats and other Vermine for preſervation of the Warren.</q> The Lords after this Speech ſhewing a greater propenſity toward the Earl's condemnation than before, the King having an account of it, came next day to the Houſe of Peers, and ſending for the Houſe of Commons told them;</p>
            <p>
               <q rend="margSglQuotes">'That Judgment being ready to paſs on the Earl of Strafford he thought it neceſſary to declare his Conſcience therein, they being ſenſible that he had been preſent at the hearing this great Cauſe from one end to the other, and yet that in his Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence he could not condemn him of High Treaſon; aſſuring them, That he never intended to bring an Iriſh Army into England, nor was ever adviſed by any body ſo to do. That there was never any debate before him of the diſloyalty of his Engliſh Subjects, nor had he ever any ſuſpicion of them. That he was never. Counſelled by any to after all, or any of the Laws of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, ſince if any durſt have been ſo impudent he ſhould have made them examples to Poſterity. That he would be rightly underſtood, for though in Conſcience he could not condemn him of High Treaſon, yet he could not clear him of ſuch Miſde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meanors, as he did not think him fit to ſerve him or the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth hereafter, in any Place or Truſt, no not ſo much as a Conſtable, and therefore he hoped they would find out a way to ſatisfie Juſtice and their own fears, and not oppreſs his Conſcience, ſince neither fear nor any other reſpect whatſoever, ſhould ever make him act againſt it.</q>

            <p>This Speech reliſht ſo ill with the two Houſes, that few of them attended next day being Sunday May 2. on the ſolemnity of the King's Eldeſt Daughter Mary being Married to the Prince of Orange. On Monday five or ſix thouſand Apprentices and other tumultuous Citizens came down to Weſtminſter to demand juſtice againſt the Earl of Strafford, and Petitions ſubſcribed with thouſands of hands were preſented to both Houſes about redreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing Grievances. Soon after the Lords paſſed the Bill of Artain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, but the King ſeemed very averſe to Paſs it, and conſulted both with Lawyers and Divines of the Lawfulneſs thereof. The Biſhop of Lincoln urged. That the opinion of the Judges and the Judgment of the Parliament thereupon ought much to ſway with

him, conſidering the terrible conſequences of an inraged multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, and that no other expedient could be found out to appeaſe the People. But the main ſatisfaction of the King's Conſcience it is ſaid proceeded from a Letter ſent to him by the Earl, to this purpoſe. <q rend="margSglQuotes">'Sir, to ſet your Majeſties Conſcience at Liberty, I do moſt humbly beſeech you, for preventing of ſuch miſchief<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            </p>
            <p>The next day the King Signed a Commiſſion to ſeveral Lords to paſs the Bill which was done accordingly. But being unwil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to part with his indeared Favourite, he ſent a Letter by the Prince of Wales to the Houſe of Lords, that mercy might be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to him as to Life, but that he might fulfil the natural courſe of his Days in cloſe Impriſonment. But the Lords ſent twelve of their number to the King to ſatisfie him that it could no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>May 12. 1641. The Earl was conveyed from the Tower to the Scaffold erected on the Hill with a ſufficient Guard, and Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſhop Uſher to aſſiſt him, where it is ſaid he deſigned to have made a Speech already prepared, to this effect. <q rend="margSglQuotes">'People of my Native Country, I wiſh my own or your Charity had made me fit to call you Friends. It ſhould appear by your concourſe and gazing Aſpects that I am now the only prodigious Meteor, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward which you direct your wandring Eyes. I would to God my Blood would cure your ſad hearts of all your Grievances. Though every drop thereof were a Soul on which a Life depend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, I could tender it with as much alacrity as ſome, nay moſt of you are come to triumph in my final expiration. In regard I have been by you my Native Country (whoſe wiſdom and juſtice in reſpect of the generality of it, is no way queſtion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able) voted to this untimely end, I have not one ſyllable to ſay in juſtification of my ſelf or thoſe actions for which I ſuffer. Only in excuſe of both, give me leave to ſay my too much zeal to do my Maſter ſervice made me abuſe his Royal authority, and howſoever I have been moſt unfortunate, yet at all times a Favourite in the proſecution of my Places and Offices, as I ſhall anſwer at the dreadful Tribunal whereunto your juſt anger hath, before nature, doomed me, my intents were fairer than my actions, but God knows the overgreatneſs of my Spirits ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verity in my Government, the Witchcraft of Authority, and Flattery of many to ſharpen it, are but ill Interpreters of my
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:57822:93"/>
intentions, which I have no argument to induce you to believe, but that it proceeds from a dying man. It would too much hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der your longing expectation of my ſhameful death to give an account of my Arraignment and Attainder, for I have been, and whilſt I breath am, the Peſtilence which rages through your Minds, your Eſtates and Trades, and you will read the Bills of your loſſes though the diſeaſe that brought the deſtruct on be removed, &amp;c.</q>
            </p>
            <p>He then declared, That he forgave all the World, and acquit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted them of his death: And beſeeched the God of Heaven hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily to forgive them. That he was never againſt Parliaments as judging them the moſt happy conſtitution, and the beſt means to make the King and People happy. That it was a great com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort to him, that the King did not think he merited ſo heavy a pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment as this. So wiſhing all proſperity to the Kingdom, he addreſt himſelf to his Prayers, and then laying down his Head on the Block, it was cut off at one blow.
